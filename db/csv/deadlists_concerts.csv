Is this the real name of the song we call  ""Cardboard Cowboy""? Or did Dick forget to put a comma after 'Mess Up a  Good thing' and the next song would be 'Carboard Cowboy'? SEE (7/3/66).

2422,1966,1966-00-00,Grateful Dead,Unknown Venue,"Unknown , Unknown",??/??/66,Me And My Uncle (1),"(1) David Sorochty:  Me and My Uncle is often found as filler on circulating cassettes, of  12/1/66, *twice* after Alice D. Millionaire. They begin Me and My Uncle  and play it for a minute or two and then it gets all messed up and they  come to a stop. They screwed it up and Jerry explains ""We can't agree  where this is gonna go"" or something close to that. After some confusion  they begin Me and My Uncle again and this time they play it to completion.  Neither the false start rendition or the one which comes to a finish are  duplication of the set 3 Me and My Uncle which is part of the 12/1/66  show. In addition, this little clip is not duplication of any other  currently (1998) circualting 1966 or early 1967 show. Its source and exact  date of origin remains unknown."
2423,1966,1966-01-07,Grateful Dead,The Matrix,"San Francisco , CA",1/7/1966,,"According to DeadBase X the following were played:  Mindbender, on the Road Again, She Belongs to Me, I'll Go Crazy, Can't  Come Down, Death Don't Have No Mercy, Parchman Farm, Midnight Hour, the  only time Is Now, Early Morning Rain, It's All Over Now Baby Blue. No  confirmation of the above on any recordings can be found.  David Sorochty:  the It's a Sin [2:52] and Sick and tired [3:34] which circulate dated as  ""1/7/66"" are just a partial copy of the ""11/29/66 Set 1"" (AKA 2/23/66)  tape. The actual date of the full tape is unknown. These may really be  ""5/19/66"". See the explanation of this on the ""2/23/66""setlist.  The fact that DeadBase has a list for 1/7/66 which includes those two  songs (in that order) is probably the reason for all the confusion in the  first place. The 1/7/66 list has been in there since the first edition or  two, but I don't know where they got it from.  Teddy GoodBear:  (See 1/15/66 - ""Portland Acid test"" for more of Bear's comments). His  comments were made off the top of his head & therefore may not be  accurate.  Owsley ""Bear"" Stanley:  there were only two Matrix shows, one in Dec '65, and the one before the  Fillmore AT. The Matrix was a crummy little closet of a venue with barely  enough room for 50 to 60 people to stand in, the big name bands didn't  play there after they got up and known. The hall couldn't pay more than  $100 for the act. They seldom had two acts/night and so far as I know  never three. The Dead played there twice when they were unknown."

This is a tape of the audio off of Ken  Keasy's Acid test video. It could be from a different date and several  shows.  Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  Up at the Fillmore Auditorium, Ken Kesey's Acid test event was in action  when I got there around the middle of the evening. The people were like  the backstage crowd at the California Hall dance (that the Airplane played  the same night). The costumes were, wow! a strobe light was flickering at  a very high frequency in one corner of the hall and a group of people were  bouncing a golden balloon up and down in it. It was a most perturbing  frequency.  in one corner there was a piece of metal, tubular sculpture by Ron Boise,  a thumping machine. If you hit it, you got different sounds if you hit it  in different places. There was a lot of electronic equipment which sent  out a low reverberation that resonated throughout the hall. and the whole  place was filled with streamers and balloons. There were tV cameras and a  tV screen, and you could see yourself in it. Onstage there was a rock  group; anybody could play with them. It was a kind of social Jam session.  a guy in a white mechanic's suit with a black cross on the front, and on  the back a sign saying 'Please Don't Believe in Magic', ran up and down  all night. Oh wow! Periodically the lights went out and everybody cheered.  Giant Frisbees, balloons like basketballs, acrobats, girls in felt  eyelashes four inches long, people with eyes painted on their foreheads,  glasses low on the nose with eyes painted on them, men with foxes on their  shoulders!

Teddy GoodBear:  Bear's comments were made off the top of his head & therefore may not be  accurate.  Owsley ""Bear"" Stanley:  Portland acid test was either on Dec 18 '65, or Jan 15 '66. There were two  which I didn't go to after my ""initiation"" at the Dec 11 Muir Beach event,  one was in Palo Alto and the other one was in Portland. There were two  before that also. Only one other one did I miss, the first one in LA in  late Feb in Northridge. So I missed a total of five of the AT's. The Dead  were always the centerpiece of the Acid tests, the real reason for its  existence, and it could not have taken place without them. The band at the  time rated their participation above any other activity in importance.  Owsley later goes on to say:  I met the Dead formally at the Fillmore show on 11 Feb '66. The Northridge  Acid test was 19 Feb, the Sunset Blvd. test was 25 Feb. I was not at the  Northridge test. Watts was in March."

Also see 03/??/66. What is most famous about the Watts test, is  the ""Who Cares"" woman.  Jeff Tiedrich:  David Gans edited 'Pigpen's Rap' and 'Schoolgirl>You Don't Love  Me>Schoolgirl' together on GDH #388 (thus no splice) for the purposes of  his broadcast. It should be noted that the date and location of the  'Pigpen Rap' is pure speculation. Dick Latvala informs us that the box and  7"" reel from which this was taken is completely unlabelled.  Transcription:  the 'rap' starts with chattering and screaming in the background and Jerry  (?) saying into the mike ""Nobody Cares"".  You can hear Bobby and then  Pigpen tells his 'story'.  When Pig is done Bobby says ""Someday Ron will take acid.""   Owsley ""Bear"" Stanley:  the ""Pigpen rap"" that Gans took from an unlabeled box, with an intro from  Jer ""Nobody Cares"" would have been an excerpt of a tape from the Watts  Acid test, or a show immediately after that gig. It is most likely,  especially if there is a bunch of static on one channel (left I think),  that it came from that test. The test, the third in LA, was in early March  1966.  Owsley later goes on to say:  this is absolutely the Watts Acid test. There was a woman who Babbs was  putting the mic onto who kept screaming ""Who cares?"" over and over at  least a hundred times. I also think I recall the comment by Bobby on Pig's  non acid-taking. There was a great Pig rap at that test, I would guess the  tape was from the Prankster's tape machine.  Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear from 'The taping Compendium':  According to Vault archivist Dick Latvala, the material here comes from  two different seven-inch reel boxes, the Pigpen rap in an unlabeled one,  the other marked ""Longshoreman's #1,"" with no other information.

David Sorochty:  the full tape is kind of a loop, with the same exact version of 'Sick and  tired' on it twice.  The second time it fades out. I believe that 'It's a  Sin' and 'Sick and tired' which also circulate separately are incorrectly  identified as ""1/7/66"".  The fact that DeadBase has a list for ""1/7/66"" which includes It's a Sin  and Sick and tired (in that order) is probably the reason for all the confusion in the first place.  The ""1/7/66"" list has been in there since the first edition or two, but I don't know where they got it from.  Teddy GoodBear & David Sorochty: SET1: Standing on the Corner [3:32] ; Mindbender [2:51] ; it Hurts Me too  [3:44] ; Viola Lee Blues [7:24] ; I Know You Rider [2:41] ; It's a Sin [2:55] ; Sick and tired Sick and tired [3:29]   We suspect due to the set list similarity that this might really be from the show that DeadBase X calls ""5/19/66"", a show that was not listed in any of their previous editions.  See ""5/19/66"" for further explanation.  DeadBase X also has ""2/23/66"" with this setlist as well as, (previous editions prior to DeadBase X), list it under ""11/29/66"".  Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain that circulate (as listed in DeadBase X)  for this date are filler that do go with ""11/29/66"". See ""11/29/66"" for  further explanation.

David Sorochty:  the unknown Jam in the 1st set sounds similar at times to You Don't Love  Me, Hog For You Baby, Big Boy Pete, or even like Deep Elem Blues (the old  way like on 12/1/66). This tape has apparently only recently (mid 1998)  come into circulation. Another tape has been in circulation for years dated 3/12/66 or 3/19/66  which contains Viola Lee Blues# (14.56), You See a Broken Heart (3.10),  and Midnight Hour# (10.44). However this is not exactly a partial copy of  3/12/66. The versions of You See a Broken Heart and Midnight Hour# are the  same as on the complete 3/12/66, but the Viola Lee Blues is definitely a  different version. So hold onto those older tapes. The full 3/12/66 tape  does not have that voice that cuts in after You See a Broken Heart that  says ""RAW"". I can't tell who that is or how it got there. David Dieterich:  Bobby talks about the funky P.A. which is making popping noises after It's  a Sin and BIODTL. Lots of talk about the ice cream man outside after the  1st set ends (after Next time)."

2461,1966,1966-05-22,Grateful Dead,Rancho Olompali,"Novato , CA",5/22/1966,,"Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  a rock & roll oasis just off Highway 101 in Navato, Rancho Olompali was  where the Grateful Dead, the Diggers, the Angels, the Black Panthers and  the San Francisco music scene went to dance after a head-banging week in  the city. The Grateful Dead were each paid twenty-five dollars a week in  those days and gigged wherever they could, often five days a week. An  incredible freedom cruised through each day like a tide. The Jefferson  Airplane, It's a Beautiful Day, Country Joe & the Fish, the Sons of  Champlin, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Charlatans, Big Brother & the  Holding Company...  Weekend free-form celebrations of whatever anyone wished to celebrate,  beginning in party clothes at the main house, ending naked in the sunshine  by the pool. In addition to the Harley-scaled acreage, a huge outdoor oven  cranked non-stop. It was the Diggers baking their daily bread to give away  later in the park. As each participant got coated with flour, ghostly  apparitions would leap from the oven to the pool, long hair flying in the  wind. It was an easy scene for music and lovers, bands interwove and  produced moments that were as high as they get. -- Grateful Dead Family  Album (page 33).  Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  the Dead used to have some pretty good parties out at their place in the  country, in Olompali. Two or three hundred people would come, and of  course, most of them probably took LSD. This was around the time that a  lot of new ground was being broken socially, and it seemed like a third to  half the people at these parties would be naked, hanging around the pool.  it was a great place. It was sort of a ranch estate that had a nice big  house that looked kind of like tara in 'Gone With the Wind'. Then there  was a lot of land around it -- hills, a creek in the back, a big lawn and  the pool. It was maybe 1000 feet off the highway, so it was fairly  secluded.  in between the house and the pool the Dead would set up their equipment  and play from time to time during the day. Usually there'd be members of  other bands there too, like the Airplane and Quicksilver, and there'd be  little jams with people who wanted to play. I remember that the Dead would  be playing and Neal Cassady would be doing this strange little dance -- it  was almost like breakdancing; very fluid. Out on the lawn there was this  very far-out configuration of plumbing that was once part of a sprinkler  system or something. It stuck out of the ground and stood maybe five feet  high. I could'nt. figure out what the hell it was for. It was just a mess  of pipes with faucets coming out of it that had been modified over the  years. Very strange. So the Dead would be playing, and Neal would be  dancing on the lawn with this bizarre metal partner. He'd dance around it,  with it really. He had some pretty good moves, too. Neal was always in the  thick of things.  Those parties -- I'm not sure how many of them there were -- were always  on a nice afternoon. Everyone would play all day in the sunshine -- just  doing everything -- and then when the sun would start to go down and it  got cold, people would pack it in. By the time it was dark most people  were gone, but there were always enough people who were either around to  begin with or who wanted to stay, so that the party would continue inside.  in fact, with the number of people hanging out there all the time, it was  pretty much a party all the time anyway. I don't. know if it was 24 hours  a day, but every time I was there it was going. -- George Hunter (The  Golden Road). Grateful Dead Faimly Album (page 33)."

This  is definitely from recording studio sessions since there is a take number  spoken quietly before most of them.

Millionaire (vocals) (see the ??/??/66 listing for more  information on those) as well as these obvious filler songs;  1969 studio - I'm a Lovin Man (Pigpen and Weir vocals, Garcia pedal steel  & John tenney on fiddle)  Instrumental (Bucky's tune)   An edited version of this circulates as ""2/5/66 Questing Beast Rehearsal"".  Based on the list provided by Steve McHenry we can see that the  differences are that the Questing Beast tape does not include:  a) takes 7 and 8# of Don't Ease Me in (both are instrumental versions)  b) Cardboard Cowboy (takes 1 through 4 without vocals)  c) Stealin' take 1 (instrumental)  d) Cold Rain and Snow# (the very last one)  e) the additional material that was identified as possibly being from the  Scorpio recording sessions (Lindy, and Alice D. Millionaire)  f) the obvious filler material which was identified as being from 1969 -  (I'm a Lovin Man and the instrumental referred to as Bucky's tune)   Steve's notes indicate that his Questing Beast tape has a brief You Don't  Have to Ask which I have not noted on my full Scorpio tape. It is probably  on the Scorpio tape and I just missed it. Steve has also reported that his  tape does not have the take number spoken before each rendition as on the  Scorpio tape. With the take numbers edited out and the filler removed in  order to squeeze this all onto one tape, it might give the impression that  this is a practice session.

July 1966 release, but the actual date of  the recording is more than likely sometime in June. See the above info  listed under 6/??/66 and 2/5/66.  From 'Taping Compendium':  Gene Estribou had the first four-track in the San Francisco area, Buena  Vista Studio, and here the Dead cut their first demo in June 1966. He was  introduced to the Dead by photographer Herb Greene, when the band was  playing in Palo Alto and Garcia still played bluegrass.  Gene Estribou:  First we had an Ampex three-channel instrumentation deck that Henry Jacobs  brought into the studio. I had built a big horn and a studio and we had  good condenser mikes and spent a lot of time optimizing the board. We went  down to Western Recording and used their studio for doing some tapes that  ended up being on the first 45 from Scorpio...  See these 45's produced under the ""Scorpio"" labels:  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/stealin.jpg  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/dontez.jpg   Michael Wanger:  Teddy,   thanks for your inquiry. Here's a bit of history:   I met Bob Weir while attending Menlo School for Boys in 1961. Through Bob,  I met his good friend, Vance Frost. Bob and I pursued our mutual interest  in folk music and eventually performed together in a band called ""The  Uncalled Four."" During the summer of 1964, while Vance and I were  traveling around the country living out of a '56 Chevy station wagon, my  brother, Peter Wanger, made a recording of Mother McCree's Uptown Jug  Champions at top of the tangent in Palo Alto.  Many years later, while attending Stanford University, I had a radio  program for which I produced a series of documentaries on various aspects  of the sixties' folk and rock and roll scene. After several programs, I  asked my friend Vance to accompany me on air in order to provide a little  more liveliness to the program. This approach was so successful that we  decided to take it to the next step. We approached KSAN's Program  Director, tom Donahue, with the idea of producing similar documentaries  for KSAN. We wanted to start with Grateful Dead because we knew some of  the band members and had the McCree recording.  Donahue gave us an official go-ahead, so in the late fall and early winter  of 1968 we began our interviews. We met with the entire band at Alembic,  the band's Marin ""clubhouse"" as they called it, and recorded everyone but  Pigpen who declined to be interviewed. We got such great stuff that we  charged ahead with interviews of John Cipollina and David Freiberg of  Quicksilver Messenger Service, Paul Kantner and Spencer Dryden of  Jefferson Airplane and Ralph J. Gleason, the jazz critic for the S. F.  Chronicle who was a strong advocate for the new music that was coming out  of San Francisco.  Starting in early 1969, we began putting the pieces together using the  equipment at Golden State Recorders where Vance worked as an engineer. To  fill out the early part of Grateful Dead's music history, we requested  some early recordings. Rock Sculley gave us the first two singles,  ""Stealin'"" and ""Don't Ease Me In,"" along with some Fillmore recordings  from 1966. We made copies and returned the originals to the Dead. The tape  box labels featured on page 104 of the ""The Deadhead's taping Compendium""  is our label for those tapes. The documentary aired on KSAN in June, 1969.  I guess there was an assumption, based on those box labels, that Vance and  I had made some early recordings of Grateful Dead. Well, sad to say, it  never happened.  Currently, I am working with Grateful Dead Productions on an Enhanced CD  of the McCree recording. The multimedia portion will contain a 1964  interview with Jerry, Bob and other band members. I also expect to include  the first 11 minutes of the documentary which traces Grateful Dead's  history up through their jug band period.  Well, Teddy, it's been fun dredging up all these memories. Please let me  know if you have any questions.  Best,   Michael Wanger  11/24/98"

Here's what's on my DAT tape which comes from a low gen reel:  7/3/66 Part 1 - some of the between song talking, then:  Viola Lee Blues  Big Boss Man  Sittin' on top of the World#  Filler (Scorpio 45 RPM):  Don't Ease Me in  Stealin'  7/3/66 Part 2:  Dancin' in the Streets  I Know You Rider#  #He Was a Friend of Mine  Next time You See Me  all of the between song talking intact with no splice and then:  Viola Lee Blues# (cuts out after just a minute or so)   it is apparent that chronologically what I call Part 2 comes first, then  Part 1 - they just overlap a bit on the beginning of Viola Lee. Most  cassette tapes in circulation have the above order with the Scorpio filler  moved to the end (sometimes the Viola Lee overlap part is intact, other  times it is cut off). A few tapes in circulation have Part 2 first and  then Part 1 with the overlap removed (which I believe is the right order)  and the Scorpio filler last.  DeadBase X does list what I believe is the correct song order and also  lists several more songs which do not circulate. They are: Unknown,  Minglewood, Cold Rain, Unknown, BIODTL, Cream Puff War & It's a Good  thing.""   Dick Latvala - According to DeadLists Digests #534:  ftp://gdead.berkeley.edu/pub/gdead/set-lists/DEADLIST_PROJECT/digest-archive/v01.n534  Dick Latvala has crossed out ""it's a good thing"" and written ""MESS UP a  GOOD tHING CARDBOARD COWBOY"". Is this the real name of the song we call  ""Cardboard Cowboy""? Or did Dick forget to put a comma after 'Mess Up a  Good thing' and the next song would be 'Carboard Cowboy'?  thayer Jennings: ""My reasoning for listing He Was a Friend of Mine and  Next time before Viola Lee:* I have three different copies of this -- two  of the three are similar to the DeadBase listing (i.e. with Friend of Mine  and Next time at the end of the set)... but the last copy came to me  mislabeled as ""04/23/66 San Fran""... but it is actually this (07/03/66).  The set list on this third copy is the same as I've listed above (cutting  in on Friend of Mine and cutting out during top of the World). The key  'dead air' segment -- between Next time and Viola Lee is intact.  There is a small bit of conversation between the two (which partially  exists on my other copies):   Next time > applause > Garcia [to band]: ""Had to do it man. I had to do  it."" (laughter) ""I just had to do it, you know how it is."" (pause, but no  splice)   Pigpen [to Garcia (or band)]: ""Viola Lee Blues"". Garcia [to audience]: ""We  had a request for this... before... before we did it. and uh...""   Lesh(?) [in background, to band]: ""I don't know, man. I can't tell by  this...(?)""   Garcia [continuing, to audience]: ""...and... it's called Viola Lee Blues.""   Weir(?): ""Aww, no...""> Viola Lee Blues.""   DeadBase X [under 'mislabelled tapes']:  Many copies of this have four additional songs after Next time You See Me.  Stealin' and Don't. Ease are from the Scorpio Records single. Lindy is  from 'Historic Dead' and Baby Blue is from 'Vintage Dead'. This tape is  sometimes dated 9/4/66.  DeadBase X [under 'Tape timings']:  there is a silver of Don't. Ease introduction that cuts almost immediately  between top of the World and Dancin'.  Before Viola Lee Blues -- Jerry:  ""We had a request for this before... before we did it. It's called Viola  Lee Blues."" Bobby: ""Oooh Nooo!""   Before I Know You Rider -- Jerry:  ""Along with our previous dedication dedicating this evening's sets on our  part to the Sundancers in Ignatio, Colorado, we'd also like to dedicate a  certain portion of this to Mnasidika, this little clothes store, you know,  down on Haight Street that has some things and it's all right, and it's  all right... indeed. We'd like to continue along the same happy vein...  with another song, no doubt.""   I Know You Rider cuts during the ""muddy Water"" verse. The beginning of He  Was a Friend of Mine is cut."

2502,1966,1966-09-05,Grateful Dead,Rancho Olompali,"Novato , CA",9/5/1966,,"Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  a rock & roll oasis just off Highway 101 in Navato, Rancho Olompali was  where the Grateful Dead, the Diggers, the Angels, the Black Panthers and  the San Francisco music scene went to dance after a head-banging week in  the city. The Grateful Dead were each paid twenty-five dollars a week in  those days and gigged wherever they could, often five days a week. An  incredible freedom cruised through each day like a tide. The Jefferson  Airplane, It's a Beautiful Day, Country Joe & the Fish, the Sons of  Champlin, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Charlatans, Big Brother & the  Holding Company...  Weekend free-form celebrations of whatever anyone wished to celebrate,  beginning in party clothes at the main house, ending naked in the sunshine  by the pool. In addition to the Harley-scaled acreage, a huge outdoor oven  cranked non-stop. It was the Diggers baking their daily bread to give away  later in the park. As each participant got coated with flour, ghostly  apparitions would leap from the oven to the pool, long hair flying in the  wind. It was an easy scene for music and lovers, bands interwove and  produced moments that were as high as they get. -- Grateful Dead Family  Album (page 33).  Transcribed by Teddy GoodBear:  the Dead used to have some pretty good parties out at their place in the  country, in Olompali. Two or three hundred people would come, and of  course, most of them probably took LSD. This was around the time that a  lot of new ground was being broken socially, and it seemed like a third to  half the people at these parties would be naked, hanging around the pool.  it was a great place. It was sort of a ranch estate that had a nice big  house that looked kind of like tara in 'Gone With the Wind'. Then there  was a lot of land around it -- hills, a creek in the back, a big lawn and  the pool. It was maybe 1000 feet off the highway, so it was fairly  secluded.  in between the house and the pool the Dead would set up their equipment  and play from time to time during the day. Usually there'd be members of  other bands there too, like the Airplane and Quicksilver, and there'd be  little jams with people who wanted to play. I remember that the Dead would  be playing and Neal Cassady would be doing this strange little dance -- it  was almost like breakdancing; very fluid. Out on the lawn there was this  very far-out configuration of plumbing that was once part of a sprinkler  system or something. It stuck out of the ground and stood maybe five feet  high. I could'nt. figure out what the hell it was for. It was just a mess  of pipes with faucets coming out of it that had been modified over the  years. Very strange. So the Dead would be playing, and Neal would be  dancing on the lawn with this bizarre metal partner. He'd dance around it,  with it really. He had some pretty good moves, too. Neal was always in the  thick of things.  Those parties -- I'm not sure how many of them there were -- were always  on a nice afternoon. Everyone would play all day in the sunshine -- just  doing everything -- and then when the sun would start to go down and it  got cold, people would pack it in. By the time it was dark most people  were gone, but there were always enough people who were either around to  begin with or who wanted to stay, so that the party would continue inside.  in fact, with the number of people hanging out there all the time, it was  pretty much a party all the time anyway. I don't. know if it was 24 hours  a day, but every time I was there it was going. -- George Hunter (The  Golden Road). Grateful Dead Faimly Album (page 33)."

2527,1966,1966-11-00,Grateful Dead,KFRC Studios,"San Francisco , CA",11/??/66,,"KFRC radio source. Interview, but no songs other than  commercially released material. According to Garcia's statements in the  interview, the interview took place sometime during the latter part of  1966. The transcription of the interview can be seen at:  http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/2635/interview66.html   tom Ordon:  in early 1967, I taped an interview with the Grateful Dead that was being  re-broadcast on KFRC in San Francisco. It was originally broadcast on KFRC  in November, 1966. The disc jockey was Steve O'Shea and the program was  called ""KFRC Perspective"". The length of the interview is 22 minutes and  22 seconds long. No songs were played. I am certain that David Gans has  the whole thing because he stopped by my home in Dallas, texas, in the  late seventies, primarily to record it. He gave me credit in the back of  his book, ""Playing In The Band"", for supplying the tape.  David Sorochty:  it begins with a pre-recorded radio station item which is like a choir  singing the numbers of the year out like this:   Nineteeeeen Sixty-Siiiiiiiiiiix!   the interview begins and Jerry, Pigpen, Billy, and Bob are present. Phil  is not and they say he had an errand to run or something like that.  There is a mention that the band has been together for about a year now.  The interviewer says that he has seen them a few times at the Fillmore.  They mention that there are fans during the interview. There is talk of  Pigpen t-shirts being available and that the picture of him on the front  of the shirt may have been on a Family Dog concert poster. They give the  interviewer a complementary Pigpen t-shirt and he says he'll have to  figure out somewhere to wear it! the whole thing is 6 mins 47 secs long.  Right in the last second of the interview the song Good Morning Little  Schoolgirl is cross-faded in as the last words of the interview fade out.  Schoolgirl gets cut after 47 seconds. This version seemed unusually clean  and sounded a lot like a prerecorded studio recording. On a hunch, I cued  this up with my CD of the first album and discovered that this is actually  the version on the first album. I am positive it is a match. Since we know  for sure the interview was in 1966, and the first album wasn't recorded  till 1967, the Schoolgirl is something that was obviously tacked on later  by someone and is unrelated to the interview."

David Sorochty:  Filler on tape - unidentified You See a Broken Heart, is from 3/12/66.  The common tapes, including mine, have this order:  Hi-Heel Sneakers  Pain in My Heart  -----------------------splice------  Cold Rain and Snow  -----------------------splice------  Beat it on Down the Line  Cream Puff War  Same thing  He Was a Friend of Mine  (Dancin' in the Street is missing)  in fact I had always thought that was the right order. I never doubted it  and that is how its been listed in DeadBase too. Notice that there is a  splice right before and after Cold Rain and Snow and that intoduction is  missing. I'm willing to accept that my tape was out of order and it also  had the intro cut out. But something about that seemed strange because I  was absolutely positive that I had heard at least part of that ""Charles  Atlas"" introduction before. But how could that be possible? I've only ever  had one copy of 11/19/66 and its not on there.  Then I saw a post from Bart Wise where he said in regards to 2/12/67:  ""I checked out my copy of 2/12/67 last night. Mine also has the Smokestack  in between the other two songs and runs:   Bill Graham Intro -no audible cut-, Cold Rain and Snow % -cuts in-,  Smokestack Lightning -cuts out-, % -cuts in- Hi Heeled Sneakers.  Bill Graham's intro is chopped up and reads: '...and on the far left...and  on the lead guitar and vocals...the Charles Atlas of the psychedelic  set...the Grateful Dead.' and without an audible cut, Cold Rain and Snow.""  there it was again, the ""Charles Atlas"" introduction right before Cold  Rain and Snow with no splice. That was exactly where I recalled hearing it  from - my 2/12/67 tape! it didn't seem likely that the same intro would be  used twice right before they start playing the same song. I wondered if  2/12/67 might be a bogus mislabeled partial copy of 11/19/66?   Even though I didn't have the intro on my 11/19/66 tape I compared the two  versions of just the song Cold Rain and Snow by cueing them up so they  were in perfect sync with each other and listening to them simultaneously.  I did this several times and found that they are note for note identical.  The real clincher was at the very end of the song in the last second or so  there is some yelling from the audience that is also on both tapes which  occurs just as it quiets down, but before the music finally stops. You can  just barely hear it, but two people yell out what sounds like ""Hey"" and  ""Yeah"" in quick succession. It sounds almost like one word ""HeyYeah"". Its  kind of hard to hear, but its there on both tapes. These are definitely  the same versions.  I then checked the two versions of Hi-Heeled Sneakers and there is some  reverb at the beginning of 2/12/67 which is not on 11/19/66 (this was  mentioned by Bart). The reverb dies down after a minute or less though for  the most part. Aside from that they do seem to be played the exact same  way on both tapes. In fact there is one time where Jerry sings the word  ""Sneakers"" and his voice kind of catches and cracks a little. That is  definitely on both tapes which is kind of odd in itself.  I checked the two versions of Smokestack and those seemed at first to be  close, but the 2/12/67 Smokestack runs slow compared to the one from  11/19/66. They do definitely come from the same time frame where they  played the song the same exact way. Even all of the ooo-oohs and  aaah-aaahs from Pigpen match up just right. The speed difference is  significant and again I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that they are the  very same rendition but they are at least very close time frame wise.  Smokestack gets cut off on 2/12/67 so you can't check for some strange  identifiable yells from the audience right at the end of the song.  The interesting thing is that 2/12/67 has been around for a long time and  11/19/66 just came out of hiding all of a sudden at the same time as  3/18/67 did back in 1989. (I checked the Smokestack on 3/18/67 and its not  the same as the one on 2/12/67 for sure).  The bottom line is that I'm convinced ""2/12/67"" is some sort of a  compilation tape. I'm convinced that the intro, Cold Rain and Snow and  Hi-Heeled Sneakers are definitely from 11/19/66. However the Smokestack  (which might actually be a studio recording) seems to be played *very*  similarly to the version on 11/19/66, but there may be some differences  and no clincher to really prove it is the same as the 11/19/66 version.  Maybe some other tape will show up from this time frame which will turn  out to be the real source for that song.  Other artist(s): James Cotton Blues Band, Lothar & the Hand People."

(see 5/19/66)  Set 2: Same as DeadLists Set 2 (see above 11/29/66), except DeadBase X do  not list 'Early Morning' & 'Cold Rain'. They list it on 2/23/66.  Set 3: Same as DeadLists Set 3 (see above 11/29/66).  DeadBase Footnote: this is probably from more than one show, dates  unknown.  (1) ""Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"" tuning after 'I Just Want'.  DeadBase X [under 'mislabelled tapes']:  tapes with this date are a mixture of at least two shows which may  actually all be from The Matrix. The time frame of this material seems to  span from January to December of 1966. Sometimes this tape shows up dated  2/23/66. We have this date listed as ""location unknown"" but whether the  Dead actually played that night remains a mystery.  David Sorochty:  Here is *some* of the in-between talking that should clarify the sets and  the reason why I'm sure that Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain and Snow  really do go where we say they do -   Side a - SET 2:   Jerry: ""I'd like to start off the second set with a Cowboy song.""  ?: ""Cowboy song.""  Jerry: ""Cowboy song.""   Me and My Uncle, Same thing.  Jerry: ""an old jug band song - it's called Stealin'""  Jerry: ""just Stealin'""   Stealin'   Jerry: ""thank you""  ?: ""Ha, ha, ha""  Jerry: ""gonna do a rock and roll song""  Jerry: ""famous old rock and roll song""  Bobby: ""for all you old geezers""   Big Boy Pete   Jerry: ""thank you""  Jerry: ""So much for our lights""   one Kind Favor   ?: ""Jerry""  Bobby: ""We already did that one.""

Early Morning Rain?""  Pigpen: ""Get outta here""  Jerry: ""Who's that out there?""  various: ""Marty, Marty, hey Marty, Marty, Marty""  Jerry: ""Yeah, with a half step then""  Phil: ""We're telling all our secrets""   Early Morning Rain   Jerry: ""Doesn't sound at all like you remembered it - does it Marty?""  Jerry: ""thank you kindly""  Phil: ""Nurse - could we have another Coca Cola up here please?""  Jerry: ""I could have done it too""   Cold Rain and Snow   ?: ""Have another Coke.""  ?: ""...next""  Jerry: ""Viola Lee Blues""  ?: ""yeah""   Side B:   Jerry: ""What are you having to drink Phil?""  Phil: ""Just plain Coke, plain old Coke""  Jerry: ""Plain old, good old, happy old Coca Cola.""  Bobby?: ""If you will.""  Pigpen: ""Ever feel like you needed windshield wipers on your contact  lenses?""  Jerry: ""Can't make it work - how do you make it work?""  Jerry: ""Ouch!""  ?: ""Want a chair to stand on Jerry?""  ?: ""All right what is it?""  ?: ""Hey that's pretty good""  Jerry: ""I like that""  Jerry: ""The name of this song is - uh - Viola - Lee - Blues   Viola Lee Blues   ?: ""thank you""  Jerry: ""That's the end of the second set, we'll be back a little later  with the third set; the third and final set. In other words that set was  the second to the final set.""   Set 3:  Down So Long  Jerry: ""thank you""  Something on Your Mind  ?: ""thank you""  Lindy, Good Morning Little Schoolgirl  Pigpen: ""thank you""  I Just Want to Make Love to You  Jerry: ""Well it's about that time again""  Merry-Go-Round tuning  Pigpen: ""Bye - we all knew that part""  Jerry: ""In spite of it all....""   I have no doubt that this is all one show. In fact there really isn't any  reason to think that it's not. It's just that we only have (mid 1998)  tapes of sets 2 and 3 (and they really are sets 2 and 3). Maybe set 1 was  never recorded or its just that it doesn't circulate if it does exist.  I also know why DeadBase does their lists the way they do:   First as I described above I think they have one of the 2/23/66 tapes with  the Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain and Snow from 11/29/66 added on as  filler. Second there are some tapes of 11/29/66 Sets 2 and 3 that are  missing Early Morning Rain and Cold Rain and Snow on side a and have  #Viola Lee at the end of side a instead (without the in between talking)  and then just set 3 on side :B.  That version is missing the talking before Viola Lee that is key to  understanding that those other two songs fit in where they do and this  really is all one show.  Without the continuing talk about requesting Coca Colas before and after  Cold Rain and Snow and also before the complete Viola Lee Blues you  wouldn't know that. That is what they must have and that is why their  lists are like that. I have the better more complete version of 11/29/66  Sets 2 and 3. I also had one of the other versions. I have never had a  copy with Cream Puff War that cuts at the beginning of side a on my  11/29/66. I do kind of wonder where it really goes, that is the only thing  in doubt.  it is possible that it is only on some 2/23/66 tapes but I'm not sure of  that. Maybe the DeadBase folks saw a set 2 and 3 from one show and this  other set that looked kind of like a set 1 and they combined them in their  books for a while. I think that is the source of all the confusion. The  doubt about 11/29/66 being from a single show is just in their minds  because they don't have the most complete copy where you can figure this  out."

To see the Concert Art:  http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/11_28_66.html   thayer Jennings: Again, this is obviously more than a single show. The  only exception to DeadBase X -- I didn't list the (1st set) Me & My Uncle  (between Alice D. Millionaire and Cream Puff War) -- my tape flips after  Alice D.M... side B begins with Cream Puff War -- so I can't tell what (if  anything) might be between them.  David Sorochty:  Me and My Uncle is often found as filler on circulating cassettes *twice*  after Alice D. Millionaire. They begin Me and My Uncle and play it for a  minute or two and then it gets all messed up and they come to a stop. They  screwed it up and Jerry explains ""We can't agree where this is gonna go""  or something close to that. After some confusion they begin Me and My  Uncle again and this time they play it to completion. Neither the false  start rendition or the one which comes to a finish are duplication of the  set 3 Me and My Uncle which is part of this show. In addition, this little  clip is not duplication of any other currently (1998) circualting 1966 or  early 1967 show. Its source and exact date of origin remains unknown.  Right before they begin the 3rd set Jerry says something like ""this is the  last set of out last appearance on a thurday at The Matrix"" or something  close to that."

2560,1967,1967-00-00,Grateful Dead,Whicker's World Video,"Unknown , Unknown",??/??/67,The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion),"David Dieterich: the Golden Road complete and uncut. 5 minutes in length, color, picture quality is fair, sound quality is good (say B+). The video portion is intense to watch. Strob lights are flashing and the camera zooms in and out very fast on the band members. It appears that Mickey was not there. There is a lot of footage of people dancing (and the guy doing the oil-based light show). Looks like a great party!  Matt Schofield: there was a tV program called Whicker's World over here [UK] - starting sometime in the late 60s I should think. Maybe also aired in the US.  Can't remember it too well but I think it was the sort of program that could have had a 'look back at the SF 60s music scene in a patronising way' edition, but maybe I'm thinking of something else.  Seems a simple enough way though for the words 'Whicker's World' to get attached to the video, rather than trying to discover a venue of that name.  Tim Anderson: it was the studio version of GR overdubbed to the performance film.  David Sorochty: Whicker's World  Announcer #1: ""...ow night. The retrospective exhibition of her work opens at the Opera Grovener Galleries in London next week.""  Announcer #2: ""An assault on the senses, an LSD trip without drugs. Flashing strobe lights, spermatazoic color.""  the Golden Road which follows is just the version off the first album.  I don't have the video, just the audio. Someone can give it another look and see if it is apparent they are lip synching. I cued up my CD of the 1st album and the Whicker's World tape and they sound the same to me, though the Whicker's tape is much more grungy of course. BTW both of the announcer's voices sound British."

The 45 minute segment has never circulated in digital format till 2013, with the exception of the 6th take (the longest one) which is part of two compilations of miscellaneous studio and live material from 1967 (shn/flac sets 81259 and 85631). This practice session is now labelled as ??/??/67.  There are several reasons to conclude it was made before November 19, 1967 - in fact before August 5, 1967 (currently the 
earliest known live Lovelight). Most importantly, from the talking between takes it is clear they are working out the arrangement. Maybe this the first time they are playing it?  There is definitely only one drummer.  Pigpen sings it a bit differently; in fact he only sings the first verse, over and over.  The band doesn't have any backing vocals except the ""let it shine"" bit, which was dropped & never appears live.  The guitar parts are much simpler; on 8/5/67 they're a lot more complex & bouncy.  They don't have a transition after the first verse.  By 8/5/67 they have a smoother drum transition.  Garcia doesn't have his soloing down for this song at all, and doesn't seem to have worked out any part other than the chords. (1) dead air for about seven minutes, followed by about three minutes of ""let it shine"" vocal rehearsals. (2) Jerry: ""It should be loud because that's the melody you know. It should be out over the others."" (3) Jerry: ""Let's go over it a time or two and get the arrangement. Hey Pig, do you want to do two verses and then into that uh drum business?  Well let's, let's decide that because that, that's uh...""  Phil: ""Bring some more grub man.""  Jerry: ""Ok that would be the stomp because..."" (4) How many verses do you want to go through on Lovelight?  I think two, two and then a drum thing. And then after, after the bridge come on back and start get back into Lovelight.  Play it man. And you'll have to play organ too. Give us a signal then, at the end. At the end, go back into the regular bar solo. Go back into the regular again. Go back into a regular verse at the end and go 'shine, shine, shine, let it shine'."

Other artist(s): Jefferson Airplane, QMS, Country Joe & the Fish and the Charlatans"". *Charles Lloyd on flute on GMLS.  Transcribed by Glenn Gillis: Best of all were the glorious free concerts in the Panhandle -- a flatbed truck, makeshift electricity, food, wine, friends, sunshine, and some wonderful bands who hadn't hit the big time yet. At first it seemed amazing that we knew by name so many of the hundreds gathered; but as the months went by, our awareness of a larger community grew until it peaked that fine day in January of 1967, the day of the tribal Stomp at the Polo Fields to be known as the ""Human Be In.""  We heard it through the grapevine, and a half dozen of us started early that morning to walk the couple of miles to the park. As we walked along Lincoln Avenue, we noticed other groups of neighbors walking in the same direction. More joined in off side streets, and by the time we turned north into the park, we were a large, laughing group. A half mile later, we were a horde and as the Be-In took shape through the day, we were awed and thrilled as the Polo Fields filled up with more than 20,000 people. It was a day of innonence and hope; and in many ways the last moments of naivete for a neighborhood that had just gone public. -- Rosie McGee from: Brandelius, Jerilyn Lee, ""Grateful Dead Family Album -- p40.

I listened carefully to that bit and here's what I got:  Midnight Hour (13.17) Viola Lee Blues# (4.10) instrumental version #Good Morning Little Schoolgirl (0.27) (with flute)  When I heard the flute on GMLSG I thought immediately of 1-14-67 and sure enough that's what it was, but just the tail end of the song. After checking the Viola Lee turned out to also be from 1-14-67, but just from the beginning up to the quick dropout in that song at the 4 minute 10 second mark. I have not really tried to figure out where the Midnight Hour comes from, but I suspect it will be duplication of something common.  I was fooled into thinking the Viola Lee was an unique instrumental version because it didn't have the end of the song which is the only place they sung the lyrics on 1-14-67. I hope this helps to clarify things for you if you come across this item.  Think quickly - where else is there a 13 minute 17 second Midnight Hour?  Teddy GoodBear: After listening to the rap in GMLSG, I'd say it's Lloyd with help from Pigpen. I've not heard Lloyd other than this recording, nor do I know what Lloyd's voice sounds like; as I'm just guessing. So I'm listing this entry as ""sounding like Lloyd"", unless somebody knows differently."

Other artist(s): QMS.  To see the concert art: < http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/01_27-28_67.html >  Bart Wise: this show is an audience tape, not a soundboard. The break between Viola Lee Blues and Cold Rain and Snow sounds like a master tape pause, and nearby audience clapping is obvious between the songs. The vocals and organ are prominent in the mix and the guitar and drums are echoey and distant; this may indicate that the taper stood near a PA stack and a bit distant from the stage, thereby reducing the prominence in the mix of instruments which received less PA sound reinforcement. All instruments are audible and there is very little hiss.  There is some distortion on loud vocal and organ passages. Morning Dew cuts in on the first note of the song, so probably only one or two seconds is missing. New Potato Caboose fades out to about 2 seconds of silence before Viola Lee Blues fades in; these are clearly cuts that occurred sometime after the master was made.  About the date of this tape: my memory may not be exactly right, but I think this tape usually circulated as 1/28/67 until sometime in the 80's, when Deadbase started listing it as 1/27/67, at which point you started seeing it traded under that date. Under any circumstances, it has always seemed a little odd to me, a little too mature sounding and stretched out for my picture of what they were playing in the very beginning of 67. Despite the fact that there are too few tapes from that era to really make any conclusions about date from content, I decided to compare with other tapes with slightly more solid dates.  First, I think this is probably all from one show, rather than a compilation as Jim Powell suggested. The whole tape has the same sound and the same mix of instruments, and from my own experience audience taping, even with the same rig in the same hall it would be unusual to get such similar sounding recordings on different nights.  The chief point of inquiry was the version of Alligator. On 1/27/67, there is a drum intro and after the initial vocal section, the band proceeds straight into jamming without the intervening drum solo. After a few minutes of jamming, Garcia sings his ""Alligator runnin' round my door"" bit, which is followed by more jamming.  Comparing this with other versions, we find that on 5/5/67 (a shaky date itself), 8/4/67, and 9/15/67, Alligator is begun not with a drum intro but rather with a Garcia guitar intro. In all three versions, the band jumps into jamming after the vocals without a drum solo, and in all three versions Garcia does NOT sing ""Alligator runnin' round...""  11/10/67 and 11/11/67, on the other hand, both start with a drum intro rather than the guitar intro. There is the signature drum solo after the initial vocals, and Garcia sings ""Alligator runnin' round..."" on both.  If I had to date the tape of 1/27/67 just on the basis of the above information, I would place it sometime in between 9/15/67 and 11/10/67. The three summer 67 Alligators are consistent with each other and different from both the ""1/27/67"" and 11/67 shows.  As for the Viola Lee Blues, at over 21 minutes it certainly seems different from versions on 11/29/66 (about 10 min), 8/4/67 (about 12 min), 9/15/67 (about 10 min, but cut), and even 11/10/67 (about 15 min, but cut.) Who could know, but it seems like it probably belongs later in the year.  ""1/27/67"" may be the right date, but it might also be a case of the taper later saying ""I think this was recorded at the Avalon in early 67."" Perhaps we should note something like ""The date is slightly questionable; tape content suggests later in the year.""  tim Anderson: I've always been of the opinion that the drum solo in Alligator didn't start until Mickey joined up. Needless to say, I have no evidence to back this up. Just a gut feeling, and the mythology of the alleged two-hour Alligator on his first show, seems to point in that direction.  David Sorochty: this tape sounds like an old audience tape, but with next to no audience noise. I believe this may be an audience tape that was recorded with the mics up high enough to eliminate crowd noise. That would be unusual for a tape this old.  Immediately after they finish Cold Rain and Snow you can hear a Schoolgirl tease for about two seconds before the tape cuts off.  I believe that DeadBase's comment that Alligator is uncertain does not mean that they are in doubt about its existence in this show, rather they mean that the general consensus is that Alligator was not played until later in that year, so Alligator throws doubt on the dating of this tape to January 1967.  Jim Powell: SET1 [78:17] Morning Dew [7:10] % New Potato Caboose [8:40#] % Viola Lee Blues [21:47] % Cold Rain and Snow [2:56] % drums [0:04] > Alligator [17:42] > Caution (Do Not Stop on tracks) [19:50] %  Most circulating copies of this tape require speed correction. This tape sounds like it was made with mics set up on the stage lip. The clapping (e.g. at the end of CRS) proves the tape was made with AUD mics. The minimal amount of audience noise proves the mics were placed way up front. The mix on the tape is the result of the mics' placement in relation to the various monitors on stage, plus the acoustic sound of the drums, plus the spillover from the PA stacks. Plainly these six tunes belong to the same show but it is not clear from the tape whether they belong to one set or two.  New Potato Caboose fades down at the end, probably close to its conclusion. DeadBase lists a Good Morning Little Schoolgirl following Caution but the tape of Schoolgirl [17:42] circulating mislabeled ""1/27/67"" with this date is actually from 4/9/70.  This tape used to circulate labeled ""1/28/67"" until DeadBase labeled the list ""1/27/67,"" noting that it might actually belong to 1/28 or 1/29.  Pigpen is of course the vocalist on Alligator.  The performances on this tape are so incendiary that it's hard to believe it comes from so early in the year, but it certainly comes from before Sept. 67, since the inimitable Mr. Billy the K is the one and only sole drummer on the tape. and actually, after listening again to 11/19/66, the strongest performance of 1966 circulating, I find it much easier to believe that the 1/27/67 tape could actually be dated properly.  I suggested that this tape was a ""composite"" because I remembered suspecting the Schoolgirl, and when I checked it just now, it was obvious that the Schoolgirl is an entirely different mix, even before I identified it as being in fact 4/9/70.  on the 4/9/70 Schoolgirl Pigpen tries to start the vocals 8 bars early, but quickly cuts himself short -- this is its easiest identifying mark. This tape of Fillmore West 4/9/70 also circulates with some bizarre chick wailing overdubbed in one channel, mislabeled ""Fillmore East 7/10/70.""  Does anyone have a copy of the Avalon 1/27/67 tape with a version of Schoolgirl that seems to actually belong to 1/27/67?  After listening again to this tape I am inclined even more strongly to nominate it as the strongest performance of 1967 circulating. (Truth to tell, there isn't a lot of competition, however.)  I still suspect that 1/27 may in fact be a falsely dated composite of shows from later in the year, especially given the well developed Alligator > Caution. I don't know if we'll ever have a definitive answer regarding the source(s) for that tape, but it's probably worth noting that the date is uncertain for more than just the Alligator > Caution.  David Sorochty: I saw the posts on these shows and was kind of surprised, especially about 10/22 and 1/27. I say that since 10/22 is CD type quality soundboard and 1/27 is a grungy echoey aud tape, they don't sound anything alike. Maybe they are two different sources for the same show? Anything is possible with these old tapes I guess. So I'll sit down and do a careful comparison.  DeadBase X has this to add: ""This tape, which is of uncertain origin, also exists dated as 1/24/67, 1/28/67 and part of 2/12/67. Keep in mind that some sources claim Alligator was not performed until June."" It's been confirmed that the segment Morning Dew [#6:54] ; [0:01] New Potato Caboose [8:25#] ; [0:02] is actually from 10/22/67"

To see the concert art by artist Hank Lelo: < http://www.pompano.net/~goodbear/concert_art/02_12_67.html >  David Sorochty: this tape is mislabeled compilation tape of material from 11/19/66. This tape was in circulation for years before the complete 11/19/66 became available. There is some reverb at the beginning of High-Heeled Sneakers which must have been added later since it is the 11/19/66 performance, which does not have the reverb.  Jim Powell: All tapes circulated marked with this date are mislabeled. High Heel Sneakers, Cold Rain and Snow, and Smokestack Lightning are all 11/19/66; the Smokestack Lightning > King Bee is Studio 67.  Teddy GoodBear: While it may be true that all tapes marked with this date are mislabeled, I have a Smokestack Lightning that I got in the late 70's marked ""2/12/67"". I'm not able to tell whether it is a studio or show version, but it definetly is NOT 11/19/66. It also seems to end without going into anything; as being not the same as below (??/??/67) ""Smokestack Lightning > I'm a King Bee"" entry. I agree with the few that believe Smokestack being played in 1966 was too early!  Teddy GoodBear later goes on to say: My Smokestak tape (which sounds very slow) is as follows -  Bob Weir Interview* [1:20] (talks about Mime troupe billed as GD formally the Warlocks, Bill Graham calling Billy K. for advice & Bill Graham is the one with the clipboard at the trips Festival). *Where is this from? If anybody has the rest of this interview, let me know.  Smokestack# [to 9:41#]  Now, I'm not sure if it's different than 11/19/66. It may be the same as Jim said. Being so slow it's hard to tell. I didn't. remember the cut I had, but there is a cut none the less. Perhaps someone with pitch control can speed it up & compare it to the 11/19/66 one."

Bart Wise: (The cut in Cream Puff War is a VERY minor dropout and occurs in the first couple of seconds of the song.)  Now I am no longer sure whether ""Walkin' Blues"" should be included in the database. It is clearly a faked-up piece where someone has spliced segments of Quicksilver playing the song together with segments of the Grateful Dead playing the song:  Jim Murray singing, Cipollina playing Pigpen singing, Garcia playing Jim Murray singing, Cipollina guitar solo Pigpen harp solo, Garcia guitar solo Quicksilver finish the song.  The cuts are carefully done, and this might be how KPIX-TV broadcast the piece. The sound quality is similar to the version of Cream Puff War. I couldn't find the other version of Grateful Dead doing ""Walkin' Blues"" (from 1966) to compare with this one, if I even have it. Finally, if it helps with dating the tape, the Quicksilver web site lists October 1967 as the month Jim Murray left the band.  David Sorochty: there is an interview already in progress that the tape cuts in on. Jerry is talking about Cream Puff War and says that it is the only song for which he has completely written the whole thing himself. There is some indecipherable talk about ""the words"", so maybe he means that he only wrote all the lyrics himself. Phil pipes up and is heard briefly and others are heard giggling in the background. The interview lasts only 24 seconds and then they go to play the song. The Cream Puff War that follows is 3 minutes and 44 seconds long.  Yeah - I know what you're thinking. There are some stories about them going on the Maze show and lip synching a song. I've even seen a picture from that tV appearance where Phil I believe, was holding a broom instead of his bass to mock out the whole lip synch thing. So I thought that even though this didn't sound like the version on the 1st album at all, it would be worth a check since if it is kind of grungy, and as it turns out this is a much longer version than the one on the LP and they *definitely* are not the same.  So - if this was from that tV show, maybe they recorded the audio there for the tV show and they just lip synched it later? Is it possible that this is from another tV appearance where they didn't lip synch or maybe from a radio program? Who knows? I guess I always just presumed that when they lip synched on the Maze show it was to a song off the 1st LP.  David Sorochty continues: Walkin' Blues which I called 1966 and we now are saying might be from 1967 ""Maze tV"" show.  Well the version I call ??/??/66 on my web site is indeed the same version of this song which switches back and forth between the Dead and QMS.  Here is what I have come up with:  it starts out with QMS playing the song, at 27 seconds it switches to the Dead playing it, at 50 seconds it switches to QMS, at 1 minute and 27 seconds it switches to the Dead, at 1 minute and 59 seconds it switches QMS, who finish it out to a total time of 2 minutes and 14 seconds.  If this is from a tV broadcast it would be really cool to see a video of this since the picture would have been switching back and forth in sync with the audio!  Jim Powell: the interview cuts in on Garcia laughing with announcer talking about Ralph J. Gleason. Interview tape with Gleason following, who introduces Jerry & asks him ""what kind of music does the Grateful Dead play. Jerry answers ""loud,"" and continues by saying that they play ""dance music."" in response to a question about their sources Jerry says that they are ""clever thieves."" Later Jerry talks about playing feedback: ""If you ignore it it just gets louder and louder."" The interview concludes with Jerry introducing Cream Puff War and saying that he wrote it.  Here's a listing of my copy of this tape, which is certainly lo gen though perhaps still not entirely complete (see below).  The Maze tV Show, KPIX-TV, San Francisco 4/8/67. Total time [19:06 +]. The Wildflowers: ""Crying in the Background"" [3:40; title is a guess]  Interviews with Ralph Gleason and with Garcia, Weir & Lesh [4:55]. This is the interview snippet where Jerry identifies the Dead as ""clever thieves.""  Grateful Dead: Cream Puff War [3:51]  the tape here contains a scrap of the announcer's voice left from a cut. Perhaps it's only commercials that were cut, together with the announcer's 'and now let's return ...'. See below, however.  Quicksilver Messenger Service: Pride of Man [3:42] Quicksilver Messenger Service: Walkin' Blues [2:23] Announcer: concluding remarks [fade down at 0:23]  Somewhere I've seen or heard Ralph Gleason quoted during this period remarking that even when San Francisco bands perform the same song, they play it differently; he gives as his example the Dead's and Quicksilver's different handling of Robert Johnson's Walkin' Blues. During his concluding remarks the announcer seems to refer to this comment. Perhaps it appeared in a passage of the show cut between Cream Puff and Pride of Man, or between Pride and Walkin' Blues. It seems less likely that the show also included a performance of the tune by the Dead."

2606,1967,1967-05-05,Grateful Dead,Fillmore Auditorium,"San Francisco , CA",5/5/1967,He Was A Friend Of Mine % Stage Banter ; The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion) > New Potato Caboose ; Alligator,"He Was a Friend cuts off. Song order is speculation by Teddy GoodBear, based on the late 70's tape and cuts.  Jeff Tiedrich: No way this is 9/29/67, which is where Deadbase moved this list for Vol 9. Their contention is that this is the famous Mickey's first show falls apart when you hear the entire tape. Alligator comes to a definite conclusion and is no way part of the infamous two-hour Alligator/Caution.  David Sorochty: the info in Deadbase about 5/5/67 really being 9/29/67 is not so of course. The song order I have is:  Dancin' Golden Road > New Potato Alligatior He Was a Friend of Mine  Alligator starts and comes to a complete finish, so all the talk of a two hour long Alligator (for the show on this tape at least) is not possible. The info listed in Deadbase saying Alligator---> Caution is obviously wrong then too.  Teddy GoodBear: on my older tape that I got in the late 70's -  He Was a Friend of Mine# [4:24] #Stage Banter [:50] Jerry: ""...We're stalling...corn plaster on his bass drum"" > Golden Road [1:58] Bob: ""This one is for Laughlin"" > Caboose# [6:48]  on my newer tape that I got in the 80's -  #Stage Banter [2:08] Jerry: ""...We're stalling...corn plaster on his bass drum"" > Golden Road [2:11] Bob: ""This one is for Laughlin"" > Caboose [9:14] Alligator [11:00] He Was a Friend of Mine# [5:06]  What's DeadBase's logic? Does anybody hear Mickey on the tape? I don't. So if there is no Mickey then the tape has to be before 9/29/67 or whenever Mickey was out of the band during the early 70's. I'll go along with labeling it, ""circulates as 5/5/67, but date is uncertain"".  As I said, I got my older copy around the late 70's from a NY trader who had a lot of ""Fillmore"" tapes in his collection. He told me the date & said it was from the Fillmore. Assuming we believe it's from the Fillmore, that narrows down the date quite a bit.  and if you look at these songs, they fit in with the other ""timeframe wise"" dates these songs were being played. If I came into this cold without any dates attached to this tape, I would say based upon other setlists that this was 3/19/67, 4/12/67 or 5/5+6/67.  Christian Crumlish, his unedited review some of which was published in ""The DeadHead's taping Compendium vol. #1"":  05/05/67, Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, California [stage banter], the Golden Road > New Potato Caboose, Alligator, He Was a Friend of Mine//  the tape itself came to me mislabeled as a ""Fillmore West Acid test 02/06/67."" Not only was there no Acid test on that date, but there was no Fillmore West in 1967 either. It probably got called an acid test along the way because of the trippy stage banter, labeled on my original as ""The Effects of Vitamin A."" My first copy of this was an audience tape but a soundboard is now available. Some tapes have the He Was a Friend of Mine first (before the chatter), but the soundboard shows that it clearly comes after Alligator.  Here's a transcript of what's said on stage before the Golden Road:  --tuning sound--  ?: Wheeeeeew  Bob and others: aaaaghh, urrrghhh, etc.  Jerry: We're stalling. We're stalling while our uh drum-- I'll tell you tell you exactly what's going on up here so nobody has to wonder anymore.  Bob?: Lay it on me. [""on"" pronounced ""own""]  Jerry: What's going on is our drummer is putting a uh corn plaster on his bass drum.  Phil?: He is lifting his left thumb....  Jerry: that's what's happening.  --bass drumming and cheers, organ notes--  Bob: OK now this is a drop-out song and as far as you all are drop-outting, dance dance dance....  ?: waauugh!  ?: Did somebody say ""waaaugh!""?  ?: waaaaeghh  Bob: Everybody say ""waaaa!""  ?: Waaaagh!  Bob: thank you--  Jerry: Gosh  Pigpen: Let me hear everybody say ""fuck!""  audience (weakly): Fuck!  Jerry (languid): Louuuder.  Bob: Everybody say ""dope""  audience: dope!  Jerry: awww  Bob: Everybody say ""primate""  ??: What?  Jerry: Say what?  Bobby: Oh yeah? ... Everybody say ""What?""  audience: What!  ??? (goober voice): Whut?  Jerry: Hey that was good that was good.  Phil: Everybody say ""Ohhh noooo!""  audience: No!  Pig (singing): t'ain't nothing 'a me...  --golden road starts--  Here are some glimpses into the personalities of the members of the band:  Bobby tends to take things to an abstracted level, his cry of ""primate"" is not taken up and leaves even the other band members puzzled. Phil's suggestion seems to be based on the sound that people sometimes make when they're tripping too hard. Pig's contribution is more earthy and natural.  The hippie attitude without the intellectual pretensions. Jerry, back when he still spoke from the stage, is actually filling in the audience on what's going on upstage, in a small way leveling the barrier between performer and fans.  The Golden Road is energetic and over quickly, segueing neatly into New Potato. (Bobby says something like ""This one if for Laughlin"" before launching into the first verse.  Highlights: the Golden Road, Bobby's inarticulate lysergic insight that we're all primates.  Christian Crumlish Writer - Editor - Literary Agent"

Bill Graham was not the emcee at the Monetery Pop Festival, so it's doubtful he would introduce the band from the stage. However, some folks have speculated that since Graham was in attendance and a friend of the Dead, he might have done the intro and or the outro as a ""guest emcee.""

August 1, Front page!  Photo of woman in African print dress and shades dancing beside guy in kind of a mod outfit. [Caption: tHIS IS tHE O'KEEFE?]  the normally staid O'Keefe Centre - a hotbed of toronto culture - took on a mod look last night as young hippies danced in the aisles to the music of the Jefferson Airplane, a rock group in the San Francisco style. Later 300 youths danced on the stage as three groups jammed for 50 minutes. Story, photo on page 19.  from p.. 19....  ""Kids dance in the O'Keefe's aisles""  By VOLEMAR RICHTER Star staff writer  Marty Balin smiled with delight as he looked over the 300 people dancing on the O'Keefe Centre stage last night. and just for fun he acted out the fear on Hugh Walker's face when the whole thing started.  Balin's group, the Jefferson Airplane, rock 'n' roll exponents of the San Francisco hippie-freedom, got the kids dancing in the aisles in a joyous freewheeling happening.  Ushers frantically tried to return them to their seats because, after all, other paying customers might want to see and besides that sort of thing just isn't done at the O'Keefe.  ""Disregard the ushers,"" the leader of one of the three rock groups on the bill shouted. Hundreds of them did and that's what bothered Walker, the Centre's managing director.  Hasty  Over at the side, he had a hasty discussion with Bill Graham, the San Francisco dance hall baron and producer of the show. Graham pointed out that the crowd was peaceful and happy and wouldn't think of tearing up those soft seats or anything else.  ""Let's just say it turned out all right,"" he said afterward, a few minutes before disappearing into a back room for more discussions with five grey-suited O'Keefe managers.  Most of the near sellout crowd last night just watched. Dozens more sat out in the lobbies discussing the whole thing over a few more cigarettes.  But maybe 300 others danced to a pounding, driving, throbbing and oozing trip of sound and color supplied by three bands.  and two light shows. Here's how it happened.  Appetizer  Before the opening dim of the lights, the three screens on stage were already giving an appetizer.  Centre screen carried the encircled, upside-down Y peace symbol, its colors slowly changing; green on blue, blue on two greens, tan on green and yellow. This screen was filled by Headlights, a group that adds the visual impact to the rock 'n' roll shows at Graham's Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco.  They work with liquid projections - colored oils swirled on a dish and projected - and rotating color wheels and loops of live-action film.  At stage right and left were two extra screens carrying color projection by a New York group called Sensefex Inc. Their work involves the projection of paint-splotch slides, electric motors that twirl the whole thing around. A movie projector showed its contents through a chute of angled mirrors that was also rotated by a motor.  Hippies  on the screens the multi-hued splotches revolved slowly forming a kaleidoscope resembling some protoplasm. Its colors were hard and deeply defined; white Headlights projected soft, gentle colors like early morning.  The audience was liberally sprinkled with hippies - in army shirts and commando hats, in beads and capes, and even in ties and jackets.  First  Band: toronto's Luke & the Apostles. started off with their hard blues-rock sound. Lead singer Luke (Gibson) hugged the microphone crooner-style as he belted out ""My Soul.""  the peace symbol started dripping colors and eventually melting away shapelessly under the liquid colors that were applied above it. Bizarre globes turned green, red and back to green and ended like a red sky with stars.  The Apostles. did two standard blues, ""You Can't Judge a Book By Looking At the Cover"" and ""Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,"" both in a tough, heavy lumbering tone, filled with science-fiction and monster noises that were interesting to hear but out of place.  ""Schoolgirl"" was also done by the next group, the Grateful Dead, but in a looser, freer version, and in the Chicago blues form it came from. It was symbolic of the free music the group plays. They take it easy and put in their improvisations naturally.  That characterizes both the Jefferson Airplane and the Dead, the latter lesser known and less inventive. But the Dead are the true spokesmen for the San Francisco hippie scene and former resident musicians with the LSD trips Festivals run by novelist Ken Kesey.  (They also have an album that its Canadian distributor can't keep in stock, though the Dead have had no radio hits).  Leader Jerry Garcia's group doesn't have as much substance as the Airplane, but they work together as precisely as parts of a machine. Two-hundred-pound Pig Pen (Ronald McKernan) gives a happy undertone to the music, while Phil Lesh plays complex bass.  No effort  it took the Jefferson Airplane, after intermission to get the dancing started. The taped sounds of a jet heralded their arrival. The group fills to stage front with Grace Slick's torchy vocal, ""Somebody to Love.""  the Airplane captured that crowd without effort. The quality of their music, its intelligence and imagination superimposed on the necessary beat, drew them out to experience total involvement with sound and color.  This music appeals to the older rock 'n' roll lovers. The young kids can't dance with the tempo transitions. The older ones do a free-form, improvised dance  Leader Balin, sings in a clear voice. Grace booms and lashes out with hers. Guitarist Jorma Kaukonen puts substance into the group's improvisations, while Jack Casady puts down a solid bass line. Spencer Dryden adds excitement with his drums, and Paul Kantner plays guitar, and sings.  They project the spontaneity freshness of youth.

From GDH: David Gans transcribed this setlist, but may not have made a complete copy of the vault tape (since it was often his practice to select from masters what he needed for his show only).  David Sorochty: ""The sound quality in Morning Dew starts out a bit grungy, but then clears up suddenly at 6 min 14 sec into the song and remains near CD type quality for the rest of the tape. Maybe the first second or two of New Potato Caboose is clipped. Before turn on Your Lovelight Jerry says 'sing you a little song' to which Phil replies 'thank you Jerry!'. Unfortunately Lovelight cuts off just as it was getting into a pretty heavy jam. Before Beat it on Down the Line'uh-hum' is said jokingly several times by several band members and then Bobby says 'good PA'. Jerry says 'twelve' and they begin Beat it on Down the Line (with twelve beats of course).  The vocals to the Other one on this tape are the earliest known and go like this:  When I woke up this morning, my head was not intact. I asked my friends about it, try to find out where it's at. A wind came up inside of me, blew the dust clouds all away. The heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.  Comin', comin', comin' around... etc.  Well the heat down in jail, they weren't very smart. They taught me how to read and write, they taught me the precious art.

Some tapes have the studio versions of Born Cross-Eyed and Dark Star which we list under 11-14-67 (see below) and others do not.

Both copies of Feedback usually are cut off by the end of the tape sides, although our timings listed come from copy which does not get cut. Other songs also can get cut on one person's tape and not on another's. Beat it on Down the Line is not on these cassettes, but reportedly is on other tapes of these shows.

Jeff Tiedrich: ""There's a bit of a mystery here. The Alligator>Caution that appears on both the 11/10/67 and 11/11/67 tapes are identical -- even on the vault reels! it is unknown which of the two dates these songs belong to, but it's not unreasonable to presume that 11/10 is the original and 11/11 is the copy. The best explanation (read: speculation) is that someone copied the 11/10/67 Alligator>Caution onto the end of the 11/11/67 reels. The master reels for these two shows were not originally in the Dead's vault -- they were stored at Warner Brothers, which is presumably where all this mysterious copying took place.""  David Sorochty: ""There is another Cryptical-->Other one--->Cryptical sequence on the Shrine '67 tapes currently listed as being from the 11/10/67 show, which definitely is not duplication of the other one (i.e. The 11/11/67 version). The two versions have slightly different lyrics. It is not duplication of any other version in circulation. Maybe they did play it both nights. If more information comes to light about this sequence and its correct date, then its status may change. This is another mystery about these tapes.  These are the lyrics of the version identified as from 11/11/67:  Cryptical Envelopment > the Other one  Well I woke up this morning, with the sky in sight. I would ask the walls about it, but they vanished overnight. I could not think to spell my name, I find there was no way. The heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day.  Comin', comin', comin' around... etc.  I was dancing through the lilly fields, when I came across an empty space. Quivered and exploded, left a bus stop in its place. A bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began. There was Cowboy Neal, at the wheel, of a bus to never-ever land.  Comin', comin', comin' around... etc.  Cryptical Envelopment  David Sorochty and Teddy GoodBear: these shows originally circulated together out of order on two cassettes labeled as '11-8,9-67' and as '11-10,11-67', however they did only play two dates - the 10th and the 11th. Some tapes have the studio versions of Born Cross-Eyed and Dark Star which we list under 11-14-67 (see below) and others do not. When the studio songs are there, they are at the beginning of the side which continues with it Hurts Me too from 11-10-67. To confuse things, some of the tapes in circulation have sides a and B reversed compared to others. Both copies of Feedback usually are cut off by the end of the tape sides, although our timings listed come from copy which does not get cut. Other songs also can get cut on one person's tape and not on another's. Beat it on Down the Line is not on these cassettes, but reportedly is on other tapes of these shows. It's apparent that there are several different transfers from reels to cassettes in circulation. They are very confusing to say the least.  The first tape usually came labeled as '11/8&9/67'.

In those days I used to hang out in the East Village and as an Xmas present to myself, I bought a sitar from this store on E 9th St called the House of Musical traditions. By the time the owner had given me a free lesson, it was near or after 8pm and I realized that I wouldn't have time to drop off my new instrument and still make it over to the Village theater (later the Fillmore East) to catch the early show with the dead. Ticket prices at the Village in those days were $2.50, 3.50 and 4.50 and the seats in the pit were removed for dancers, so you could pay 2 and a half bucks to hang out and dance in front of the folks with the $4.50 tickets.  This didn't help me any as I had only pocket change after my big purchase. I had seen the Dead 3 times previous, twice at the Cafe Au Go Go and in tompkins Sq Park back in june, so of course I had to go to both shows tonight. On the way over to the gig, I bumped into a couple of friends who didn't have any money either and decided it was too cold to hang on the Street and they'd come along to the show. I could've walked an elephant down 2nd Avenue that night and gotten less attention than my sitar, which I was carrying over my shoulder. Seems everybody heard of them but never saw one up close. Must've shown it off to a dozen people who stopped me along the 3 block walk to the theater.  When we got there, we found a few more folks who also had a desire to see the band and a lack of money. No Problem, we say. Follow us. On 6th St., there was this door that was open and you went up a flight of stairs, if you took a right you were at the East Village Other offices and if you took a left, you were in this room full of circuit breakers, went through a door and were in the foyer of the ladies room in the balcony. This was a well known secret among some of us locals and we had caught a fair number of free shows this way. I guess somebody discovered that the door was unlocked, as tonight it was locked tight. Disaster.  Back down to 6th st., pull down the ladder to the fire escape for the balcony and head on up in hopes of getting somebody inside to pop the door. Not only no luck, but we got the distinct feeling that this old fire escape was going to come down if we hung out much longer. After a hasty retreat, we are at our wits end. Short of storming the gate (which we weren't into), it seems that we are left out in the cold, so to speak.  Things were looser in those days, esp when it wasn't crowded, so the 6 or so of us duck into the lobby to warm up and see if we could con the lone ticket taker. I notice him looking at my sitar so I immediatly sit down about 6 feet from him and start to strum. Over he comes. ""Farout man, a sitar!"", etc. Over his shouolder I see my co conspiritors walking into the theater. He suddenly remembers he's working and turns around to catch the action and goes running after them. Job done, i sling my instrument over my shoulder and walk right in. I don't think he tried too hard, as I saw most everybody who walked in during the course of the evening. No, I don't remember the set list, only that Pig did a bitchin Schoolgirl and at the end of the first show one of the band said if we wanted to stay for the late show we were welcome to, and another one (Weir?) said ""yeah we didn't sell any tickets for that one either.""  Anybody out there at that show? Anybody remember taking part in our ""creative"" gatecrashing? BTW, in my 28 years almost to the day of seeing the Dead, 6/67-6/95, that was the only time I ever crashed the gate. I did see the guy i conned later that evening and he just looked at me smiled and shook his head, so i guess he was more impressed with our creativity than pissed about our getting in.

Only Country Joe and the second Dead set were FM broadcast. Much of this show was used for Anthem of the Sun.  The cuts at the start of the first 3 songs of set 1 appear to be very brief - just the first few notes of each intro. China Cat Sunflower and the Eleven blend seamlessly together; evidence seems to imply that they were one and the same song during this period (see David Gans' interview with Robert Hunter in his book ""Conversations With the Dead,"" p.24). Lovelight contains a small splice/dropout at about 3:14. Many Set 1 tapes in circulation only include Dark Star thru Lovelight.  (1) After Lovelight: Weir: ""Thank you.""

Garcia: ""Yeah, Happy Lavelle, and we'd like to dedicate (unintelligible)...and also..."" Lesh: ""Whole set, whole date, whole year..."" Garcia: ""And also, we respectfully dedicate this set to the memory of Neal Cassady."" (audience cheers) Weir: ""And in particular this song.""

Weir: (off-mic, counts off Cryptical intro)  (3) tape flip in Alligator jam appears to be the same one as is on copies from the older source.  (4) Midnight Hour cuts mid-jam at [6:02] on the SBD, significantly earlier than on copies from the old FM source. On those tapes, only the last few notes appear to be clipped, with the song timing [9:51] to that point. Some copies in circulation do have the continuation of the Midnight Hour encore patched in, after which the following announcement is made: ""Hey remember, we're all prisoners till everybody is free. So tomorrow come out to San Quentin - they need our support. One o'clock, or one-thirty, or two o'clock. Anytime around then. Country Joe and the Fish came here from New York tonight, uh, and so when they left it was about four o'clock their time (in the morning) and they got up at eight. They wanted to stay around, jam some more, but - uh - their gonna rest up and come out to San Quentin tomorrow - as well as the Dead, and some of the Airplane, and some of the other bands."" Then the KMPX radio DJ then comes on and questions weather they will play some more, determines that they won't, and then says that the time is now twenty past two. The timing for this song needs to be updated to include the ending and the post-show banter."

Garcia, Cassidy, one of the guys from the Charletans, maybe Barry Melton from CJ&Fish were playing on flatbed trucks. I think there was a strike on in the prison."" An article also appeared in the Ukia Daily Journal on 2/16/68.  An excerpt: by Gordon Sakamoto Five hundred hippies danced and sang on a grassy knoll outside San Quentin Prison Thursday in a show of sympathy for the men behind the walls. The songfest involving long-haired, bearded young men and sack-wearing girls was to coincide with a threatened strike of prison inmates which never materialized. The Grateful Dead played for the flower children on the sunny hillside overlooking San Francisco Bay... ... The Grateful Dead rock group set up their electronic gear on a flatbed truck and the music blared for about three hours.  Convicts may have picked up a few strains of it before their afternoon meal.  The hippies trickled away as darkness came."

There were 6 or 7 reels (10 inch reels at 15 ips, two track quarter inch tape). The reels labeled one and two were missing all the vocals and one of the drummers. David thinks its Billy that got left out of the signal that went to the recorder on those tapes. The first two reels are believed to be from the 22nd, because some songs on the reel labeled ""Three"" are songs repeated from reels one and two. None of 2/22/68 was used for Dick's Picks #22. David recalled that two of the songs that were played on 2/22/68 were Morning Dew and Beat it on Down the Line. The end of this show was posted on the February 12-18, 2007 Taper's Section web page on Dead.net. It can be listened to online. The lyrics are so low in the mix they can barely be heard in only a few places. The beginning  of Dark Star is clipped off, as is the end of Caution.

I'd been to San Francisco and seen the Mime troupe in the park and the beautiful people in their 1890's garb. I'd hang out on the Sunset Strip. I didn't have a car. I found that I liked to hitchhike. I could always get a ride with a longhair. Longhair meant something. I wore cowboy boots or moccasins, striped t-shirts & love beads.  Flower Power was going to end the war. It was 1968, before the assassinations.  I went to the early show on Saturday as the guest of some ushers who were the parents of one of the guitarists in a band I was in. I was a young teen, my friend couldn't make it & I essentially was there alone all afternoon studying their amps & equipment until a hippie came over and politely asked if I was ""with the Grateful Dead family?"" it felt like my opportunity to run away with the circus.  When the show eventually started, I left my seat and stepped onto the edge of the revolving stage and enjoyed the concert from a few feet in front of them -- mesmerized. I remember Jerry smiling at me smiling at him eye-to-eye. I got ""in-to-it"" (and them) and in my budding brain, I felt like sometimes he was playing to me; I was vacuuming-in the energy like a little black hole.  I was impressed with every little detail; from the way their name was intricately stenciled on the speaker cabinets, to the little round buttons with hip slogans and anti-war sentiments written on the, and especially Pig Pen's menacing presence. He was the front man. Like a bonfire. It was all Pig Pen & Jerry Garcia to me. They were the kind of jamming band I wanted to be in.  They had an album in the record stores and I rode my bicycle over to the shopping center to get it. I still have it. I think it was mono with a sticker that was pasted over the word stereo. I played it for everyone who'd hold still but the record didn't capture their live magic. I was the only Grateful Dead fan I knew. A few years later, Workingman's Dead & American Beauty got some airplay when the Underground FM radio scene emerged. I'd go see them whenever I knew they were playing nearby. They always affected me somewhere deeply interior.  When Ron died, I thought it was the end of them. But they expanded to fill new vistas. A great band. Whenever I hear the first notes of Viola Lee Blues, or Good Mornin' Little Schoolgirl, or Morning Dew -- I'm there as eager as one of those baby geese you've seen in the classic psychology experiment -- ""imprinted"" onto another species; following the tortoise like it was its mamma."""

The Dead opened 5/5/68 with Bob Weir saying to the NYC crowd, ""Welcome to San Francisco."" Then Phil hit the opening chords to Morning Dew on his Guild Starfire Bass, played through a bunch of Fender Showman and or Dual Showman Amplifier heads and Sunn 2000S Speaker Cabinets with 15"" JBL Speakers, reinforced through a PA with JBL and or Altec Lansing Speakers. Garcia played his '52-early '53 Gibson Les Paul Gold top, plugged into maybe 6-8 Fender twin Reverb Amplifiers with 12"" JBL Speakers. He had an octopus chord going to all the inputs of the amps. Were some of the twin Reverb Amps borrowed from Jorma? Jack Casady also played his Guild Starfire Bass with the Airplane, also plugged into Fender Dual Showman Amplifier heads, going to Sunn 2000S Speaker Cabinets with 15"" JBL Speakers, but Jack's bass had all the Alembic Filters in it that Phil finally had installed in his in '71. Jack also used a Versatone combo amplifier with a 12"" speaker in it. That amp gave him some of his dirt, along with some of his filter settings if he choose, but the Versatone became a great decay amp for him. 5/5/68, haven't heard one note of it since, other than my recall, tape anyone?!?!"""

The setlist information was provided by Kenny Schachat, an eyewitness. Kenny attended the Early Show, and remembers that the Dead played only one set per ""show"". He says: ""I was at this show in the 4th row. Also, there was only one set at that Fillmore East early show. The Dead were the second of three bands on the bill. Headlining was the newly formed Jeff Beck Group with Rod Stewart on vocals on their first U.S. tour. They were great, too! I think the first group was Buzzy Linhart's band. I'm quite certain that Morning Dew was the first song or at least very early in the set, that the Cryptical > Other one > Cryptical > Caboose came after and was the bulk of the set, followed by one or two at the end. I'm less certain, but I believe they played Good Morning Little Schoolgirl. I'm certain that they did not play Lovelight. I'm pretty sure that they also did not play Saint Stephen."" Since Kenny's memories of the Early Show conflict with the circulating tape it seems reasonable to assume that the tape is from the Late Show. Kenny also remembers that Jerry was playing the circa '56 black Gibson Les Paul Custom for this show.  Someone else who must have attended one of these shows has reported ""The first time we heard Dark Star was at the Fillmore East in the late 60's. It was the whole set. Before they started, Bobby (or somebody) said, ""Wes Montgomery died last night. This is for him."" The date given in music books for Wes Montgomery's death is 6/15/68.

Jim Powell: ""This is primal Dead, one of the best sets in circulation from any year. The ""space"" or ""feedback"" begins from a dead start - there is a second of silence beforehand. The 2:23 Saint Stephen jam following ""what would be the answer to the answer man"" is of unique ferocity. There are numerous Caution teases in Lovelight, and the shift from one to the other is almost imperceptible. After 9:00 into Lovelight much of the time Caution and Lovelight are happening simultaneously (shades of Chales Ives!). Jerry sounds the introductory Caution flourish pointedly at 10:06 but the band doesn't follow. He tries again much more emphatically at 10:32 and this time they round the corner. The tape cuts off with the beginning of the applause. This is an excellent job of early audience taping. The mics are quite close in and there's minimal audience noise. Unfortunately most circulating copies are high generation and many are somewhat hacked up. It is possible that to complete the set we are missing songs before the opening Space on the tape; otherwise this is perhaps tHE most hard core opening of any Dead set in the history of the band. It is possible that we are missing songs between Saint Stephen and Alligator, but the pause in the tape between these songs sounds like the pause-button pause between songs characteristic of early AUD tapes. It is improbable that there were more tunes following the concluding Feedback, unless there was an encore.  Dick Latvala has stated that no soundboard of this show exists in the vault. Says Dick, ""so stick with that audience, folks."" (Dupree's Diamond News interview, vol. 27, 12/94, p.16).""

An announcer introduces the band before Schoolgirl: ""All right! It's time to either stand up, sit down, or shake your leg, or go for yourself - 'cause the Grateful Dead are here!"". After Schoolgirl, Bobby says ""Lady's choice - this number is a lady's choice"". After ""one man gathers what another man spills"" in Saint Stephen, Bobby says ""I want you to know that's how it is"". The Eleven timing does not include the ""William tell"" verse, since that is how the track IDs are set up on the official release CDs. After Lovelight: ""thank you, thank you, we got it, hold it, we got it, just do it, ok"". The plug was pulled on the PA at 6:46 in Morning Dew and just the drums continue for another few seconds. After Morning Dew, Jerry says ""got turned off - once again! Good night everybody"". Then the announcer says ""The law says that's all, so I guess that's it. Thank you once again"""

In the first verse, Jerry sings: ""Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes. Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis."" and then, instead of ""Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion"" he sings: ""Glass hand dissolving... recedes in the nights of goodbye"". He realizes he's out in no man's land as he sort of trails off a bit while singing ""goodbye"". The next verse is: ""Shall we go, you and I while we can, through the transitive nightfall of diamonds?"" He sings ""transitive NIGHT fall of diamonds"" as if expecting Phil to hit the high harmonies, but realizing as soon as he sings ""night"" that no one's coming to the rescue.  (2) the fragment of Bill Graham's intro on Side B of the tape preceding Schoolgirl runs: ""...this whole thing, it's like 900 years old by now, the grateful Grateful Dead."" The best, oldest copies of this recording have Bill Graham's intro before Schoolgirl at the beginning of Side B, and there is no splice between the intro & the tune. This insures that at least Side B (if not the entire tape) isn't from 8/28/68 at the Avalon at all! they did play at the Avalon on 8/28/68, but the venue for this recording would have to be the Fillmore West. The most likely correct dates for this recording are Fillmore West shows such 8/20, 8/30, 8/31, 9/1, and 11/7,8,9,10/68. DeadBase used to erroneously list the Schoolgirl as the encore, since many cassette tapes do have it at the end of Side B. They have just dropped it from the listing entirely in recent editions. This Schoolgirl is one of several Schoolgirls also circulating mislabeled ""Fillmore Aud 2/12/67."""

Previously, this show has circulated as both 10/9/68 and 10/10/68. In addition, this has circulated broken up into two parts, with the second half labeled as ""Set 1"" and the first half labeled as ""Set 2"". The split between the two ""sets"" came about 16 minutes into the jam before the Lovelight Jam. Although Casady sat in for three songs for the Jimi Hendrix Experience's 10/10/68 late show at Winterland, it has been concluded that the date for this is 10/10/68. Maybe he ran from one theater to the next? Bill Gadsen has confirmed this song order (the old tapes had the order reversed), that it's all one set, and stated that Peter Abram's reels were labeled as 10/10/68. These conclusions are supported by comments made by Dick Latvala. On page 26 of issue #34 (Summer 1996) of Dupree's Diamond News, Dick Latvala stated in an interview ""There's 10/10, and that's got songs like It's a Sin, a harp jam, a blues jam, a Dark Star Jam, Lovelight, Alligator, Death Don't Have No Mercy, and Dark Star"".  (1) with Paul Butterfield on harmonica. Bjorn Bergstrom, who collects Paul Butterfield live tapes doubts that the harmonica player on this show is Butterfield since the singing and playing, especially on Look Over Yonders Wall (a Butterfield Blues Band standard), doesn't sound like Paul Butterfield at all to him. He also points out that you can clearly hear Mickey asking a guy named Marvin to come up on stage and sing and play harmonica with the band. (2) very similar to New Potato Caboose. (3) starts very much like the post-drums portion of Alligator, and contains a brief, Spanish Jam-like theme. It also contains many hints of Caution (Do Not Stop on tracks). (4) cut here is likely quite small."

Admission is a flat $2 per head. Children under 12 will be admitted free.  Al Bridges, an Indian leader who has led numerous fish-in protests at Frank's Landing near Olympia, will introduce the Dead.  Suzette Bridges, a vivacious and articulate young lady, will present the tribes' side of the fishing feud.  Backing the Dead will be the Bryon Pope Ensemble from Los Angeles, Easy Chair, Light, and Papa Bear. The Retina Circus light artists will provide illuminations.  Part of the funds from the benefit will be used to establish a bail fund for Indians and others arrested for allegedly illegal fishing. This year alone there have been 27 gillnetting arrests. Bail - formerly set at $250 - has been raised to $1000.  The Indians also must replace nets confiscated by the state. They cost between $60 and $100 apiece.  Some 40 persons, Indians and non-Indians, have established a communal colony at Frank's Landing on the Nisqually. Some live in teepees; others in tents and crude hogans. They contend that the Medicine Creek treaty of 1854 gave the Indians the right to fish in ""their usual and accustomed places"" for ""as long as the sun shall rise, the streams shall flow and the grass shall grow.""  the state, on the other hand, claims the treaty is invalid and that the Indians must adhere to seasonal regulations.  The colony at Frank's Landing is seeking to re-tribalize, to return to the bounty of Nature. But it hasn't been easy. They've been tear-gassed, terrorized and hassled by citizenry and officialdom alike.  Now they've dug in for the winter. It promises to be a long, wet one.  Their choice of the Dead for Sunday afternoon's gig is an apposite one. The Dead more or less started the whole concept of group tribalization on a musical level. Beginning with Ken Kesey and his early Acid test prankstering, the Dead (originally called the Warlocks) have solidified under their chief, Gerry Garcia, as a sub-tribe with something to say - and the sound and talent to give their message a voice.

It is hard to say how much is missing from the beginning of Bid You Good Night, which might be an encore.  After Bid You Good Night someone (Phil?) says ""Look around for us next time this weekend. Hey. You see to it - You see to it that we have a place to play out there"". They did play in Ohio two more times that weekend.  At the Garcia vs. Garcia trial a couple of years ago Phil had to testify and he spoke about this very show! He was asked to date a letter that Jerry had written to Mountain Girl where he mentions a concert in Athens, Ohio. Phil was absolutely positive the letter was from 1968 because they only played in Athens once - on 11/23/68. That was because so many students from Ohio University in Athens came to the show in Columbus on 11/22/68 (a long drive - about 1 1/2 hours or so) that the band decided to go to Athens and put on a free show for them!"

It was trashed by a fire sometime in 1970. It is not the same place as the Syndrome, where they played on 11/27/70. The setlist information was provided by Ron Ramsey, an eyewitness: ""I was at the 11/27-28/68 shows at Chicago's Kinetic Playground aka Electric theater. My memories of the setlists are quite sporadic, although, these being my first Live Dead shows, as I heard each tune for the first time, it was if another Veil of Illusion was being removed... like stumbling upon a Burning Bush and seeing the Face of God, or walking on a beach and finding the Seashell of Buddha. Those memories are indelibly etched forever. There might have been an initial opening band...but for certain Procul Harum preceded the Dead. While watching Procul from the edge of the dance floor, I noticed a guy in front of me with a long ponytail stuck down the back of his shirt. My God, it was Bob Weir! a lot of us tucked our hair away back then... this was, after all, 1968 Chicago--Mayor Daley's Cop Fiefdom - things did get a little hairy out there from time to time. I had the strongest impression that Weir was watching Procul Harum and thinking: ""Shit, we're better than these guys."" Anyway, Weir opened the show on the 27th with a jolly: ""Happy turkey Day!"" it was thanksgiving. I know for sure they did: 'That's it For...The Other one' that first night, as I remember my jaw dropping when I heard the opening notes. Also on the 27th: Alligator. As for the rest of the songs, they did pretty much the standard repertoire for late 1968: Doin' that Rag, Dupree's, Dark Star > Saint Stephen > the Eleven > Lovelight, Feedback, etc. But other than the two mentioned, I cannot say which nights they did what. Sorry. (They did not, to my eternal regret, play New Potato Caboose either night... I never did get to hear that tune live.) Other factoids: Both nights were two set shows, with the Dead as the closing act. The Dead's amps all had tie-dye front covers. On the back of the amps was stenciled a white lightning bolt on red/blue background surrounded by the words: Spirit of Creation. I guess this was before the skull/bolt motif. A guess: about 200 people attended. Ah, the Old Days... I probably recall what they wore more clearly than the specific song order. T.C. had on one orange sock, and one green. Weir had on a belt with ""Bobby"" stitched in beads across the back. (At a later show, my friend showed Weir a photo he had taken of this, and Weir responded: ""Oh my God...the Bobby Belt."") Jerry Garcia was wearing a woolen poncho. After the first night-first set, I stumbled upon Garcia off by himself near the refreshment stand. Compelled to say something to him, I ended up asking for clarification of lyrics I couldn't understand from Anthem. Jerry was very gracious. Anyway, I got to shake the hand that shook the Hand. One other anecdote: on the 2nd night, my same photographer friend, tripping, somehow found his way upstairs to the dressing rooms. He sat next to Weir, who was reading the Seed (our underground 60's Weekly). At some point he asked Lesh how he could get into the Road Crew. Lesh responded ""You just want a way to get to California."" Then Lesh pointed to a huge heavy wooden table and said: ""If you can levitate that, you're in."" Alas, my friend missed his Golden Opportunity."""

The Eleven comes to a stop after the usual opening jam. Someone is heard saying ""Fade out"". Bobby explains they need to rearrange some things to correct an echoing problem. Bear suggests everyone on one side of the auditorium go over to the other side and vice versa.

What I remember about the Dead concert is absolute fascination at the music. The club was called the Catacombs in Houston, tx. Most of what was played was from Anthem of the Sun (That's it for the Other one, Cryptical Envelopment, etc. and a very good 'space jam' that came back into the album to finish). There was a second keyboard player, besides Pigpen, so this was probably Constanten. I also know for sure that Morning Dew was played mainly because it was my favorite from the first album), also I remember Garcia's introduction to the song '...let's get the old shit out of the way' and then the cymbals starting up Morning Dew... Schoolgirl was probably played but I'm not certain... I know Pigpen definitely had a couple of songs, but mostly stood around looking uncomfortable..."""

These tapes have been in circulation since the 70s.  The longer tape begins with the Dark Star and cuts just as they are starting the transition bridge out of Dark Star ; copies in circulation are quite degraded SBD and sometimes circulate labeled AUD.  The shorter fragment contains the last 12:54 of the Dark Star and is rather less degraded than the other tape, but still considerably.  T.C.'s keys insure the '69 date.  The 1st vocals start at 6:44 and finish at 7:43, and they never really go into space afterward, marking this Dark Star as early summer 69 at the latest, but it is definitely somewhat after Live Dead.  Riffs resembling Sputnik occur around 12:20.  2nd vocals start at 18:34 and conclude at 19:29.  The longer tape breaks off 0:09 after the conclusion of the 2nd vocals ; the shorter fragment continues for another 0:22 to the end of the transition bridge, and then cuts.

It sounds like it might not be the end of the show. This also circulates as 8/29/68, due to misreading Dick's handwriting on a tape box.

According to some reports the Dead performed at an event called the ""Celestial Synapse"" which took place on this date at Fillmore West.  They may have played Dark Star.

See this date for more information on this tape. So far we have not been able to locate any information confirming that there was also a show played in Merced on 3/27/69 and presently we think that probably there was no show on that date -- but this remains uncertain.  The Merced date does not appear in the Book of the Deadheads ; presumably its presence in DeadBase derives from the Tambakos-Menke transcription of the cassette master (see more under 3/28/69)."

Just before Cryptical Envelopment and again before Alligator Bobby noodles the opening chords of Weather Report Prelude. In the pause after It's A Sin Jerry asks the audience ""What do you want to hear that lasts 10 minutes"" -- obviously he'd just been told by the Avalon's stage manager that they had 10 minutes left on the set.  The following sequence beginning with Alligator runs 19:56, mostly on the strength of a monumental passage of Feedback.  Perhaps this has a bearing on the stage manager's draconian behavior in unplugging the Dead the following night during Viola Lee.

Presumably these tunes belong before That's It.

There are two SBD masters of this show -- reels and cassettes.  One master has 6 minutes cut from the Cryptical reprise ; the other master (or circulating copies) cuts in just after the beginning of The Other One and runs unbroken through to the conclusion of the set.  Between them, the two masters contain the complete show.  Composites circulate, but also many partial combinations and unpatched fragmentary versions of That's It For The Other One.  Collector beware.

SBD of parts of this show have circulated for years, sometimes mislabeled ""Family Dog 8/29/69.""  About an hour of FM excerpts were broadcast in the early 90s.  Copies of one of the masters only emerged recently and optimal complete composites are finally beginning to circulate. Rob Bertrando writes:  ""The partial reel master of 6/5/69"" is plagued by 'scrape flutter.'""

Jr. Walker's gonna come on, and the Glass Family again, and we'll be back for a second set later on, so everybody hang around, and we're gonna end up with this little short tune.""  This implies that the sequence of sets on Sunday ran:  Glass Family, Dead, Jr. Walker, Glass Family, Dead. It's impossible to tell for sure from the circulating tapes whether the Dead played 2 sets every night, whether we have any of the Dead's portions of these shows complete on tape besides the 5th, or how much we might be missing. It does appear that we have the whole, or very nearly, of 6/5/69, in 151 minutes of tape, as two 75 minute sets. What we have of 6/7 is all one set, likely the complete set, timing 95 minutes.  If the structure of the show on the 7th was as on the 5th & 8th, there should have been another Dead set on the 7th, another hour of music plus or minus, and what we have must be the 2nd set.  Of this putative 1st set we have no trace on tape, and apparently there is none in the vault.  So maybe there was only one Dead set on Saturday. 6/8 is also fairly clear, consisting of the phenomenal 47-minute first set plus a second set during which Jerry and Pigpen sit out the first 45 minutes and then close with a rather lackluster That's It > Cosmic Charlie, a total of just 120 minutes of music, but very plausibly the whole of a laid-back Sunday show at the end of a party-hard weekend. 6/6 is the most puzzling case, with its 80 minutes of circulating tape (Eaton lists 88 minutes).  Garcia does not play on any of the material listed in Set 1. Jeff Cotsman suggests that 6/6 is the show McNally mentions at this venue in '69 where Jerry was too dosed to play.  If this is the case then maybe we should also consider whether the Lovelight circulated as ""6/6/69"" in fact belongs to 6/8/69, and the Lovelight listed as 6/8/69, without Garcia or Pigpen and with Bishop and Ceballos, as well as the two Ceballos tunes, in fact belong to 6/6."

Checkin Up On My Baby features his vocals.  There is a brief cut in Checkin Up On My Baby at around 2:05. It is not clear from the circulating tapes whether the 48-minute Lovelight was part of the same set as the rest of the material.  This is probably the longest Lovelight ever played and certainly the longest in circulation. Jeff Cotsman suggests that this is the show McNally mentions at this venue in '69 where Jerry was too dosed to play.  If this is the case then maybe we should also consider whether the Lovelight listed here in fact belongs to 6/8/69 and the Lovelight there, without Garcia or Pigpen, and with Bishop and Ceballos, and the two Ceballos tunes, in fact belong to 6/6. The tapes of Dire Wolf, Dupree's Diamond Blues, and Mountains Of The Moon in circulation mislabeled ""6/6/69"" are all from 6/7/69. See the Note On Fillmore West June '69 in the Comments for 6/5/69.

A review by Peter Goddard in the Toronto Telegram for Wed. July 9, 1969 refers to performances of Casey Jones and Morning Dew.  These tunes were probably from the Early Show.  In the Toronto Star Jack Batten notes that the early show opened with two country tunes, the rest of the set consisting of a variety of blues, more country, and ""numbers reminiscent of San Francisco's early rock days.""  Bob Langmaid thinks these may have included Mountains of the Moon and Doin' That Rag, and probably St. Stephen.  According to Malcolm O'Brien, who attended the early show, the two opening country tunes were Green Grass and El Paso, with Garcia on pedal steel for both.  He also distinctly remember That's It For The Other One and thinks they may also have played New Potato Caboose.  David Galbraith, another audience member, confirms Green Grass, The Other One, and Morning Dew."

Probably more of this show exists on the AUD master, but only this portion seems to circulate.  Timings given here represent a composite of the SBD and AUD. At the beginning of this show Jerry says ""Testing.  Testing.  Testing.  People of New York!"" -- Phil interjects ""We space niggers greet you"" and then Jerry continues:  ""Now folks we understand from the management of this little establishment that if you want to, you can dance.  And I'll tell you where we're at behind it, it's really nice to play when people are dancing."" Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on Hard To Handle and Silver Threads.  At the end of Mama Tried they try to go directly into High Time and then break off -- ""Gotta tune up:  the weather is awful for tuning"" says Jerry.  The drummers chant is barely audible on the SBD and inaudible on the AUD (there were no vocals mics for the drummers ; it must be the drum mics picking it up on the SBD).  The Jam between Alligator and The Other One includes references to The Other One and to Caution, but is very much its own animal.

The band is Garcia, Kreutzmann, Hart, Lesh, and Howard Wales on keyboards.  The keyboards are very forward in the mix to start with.  The mix is rather bad for the first 20-25 minutes but then improves ; the left channel drops out briefly twice while this remix is being done.. Dark Star evolves into a series of Jams, with the keyboard prominent, particularly at first.  There is probably a minute or so missing at the flip and they are working a rather different riff (in the same key) when Side B resumes, but there is basic continuity between the two sides.  Plainly the 16 minute Jam beginning Side B is an extension of the Dark Star Jam that breaks off at the end of Side A.

The snippet of Good Lovin' which follows this on some copies of this side does not belong to this date.   On the other side of this cassette are six tunes from a Jefferson Airplane set from this date (Somebody To Love, Young Girl Sunday Blues, Wooden Ships, Volunteers, Saturday Afternoon, Uncle Sam's Blues). On the old cassette Dark Star is preceded by a count off and a 1-note false start from Phil, followed by a second count off.  This is clipped on the newly circulating copy. According to DeadBase IX before Dark Star they played Good Lovin' ; Me & My Uncle ; China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider ; Casey Jones ; High Time.

It is impossible to tell from the tapes in circulation whether this is two sets or one, but it seems long for one (notice also the 1st-set-concluding Cumberland on 12/11/69).  Circulating tapes are superceded by the release of this show as a Dick's Picks selection. The China Cat > Rider circulates in rather poor AUD.  There are no other signs of the rest of this AUD master in circulation.  The tape of Dark Star through Uncle John's Jam in circulation labeled ""AUD"" is in fact a very degraded copy of the SBD.

On the circulating tape the second part of Caution breaks off at 16:22, as Pigpen is winding it down.  This could be an hour-long reel running out.  There must be from 40 seconds to 2 minutes or more of transitional Jamming missing here.  When the recording resumes after this splice the band is playing a Jam in 4s.  After 12 seconds of this someone recites: When ya goin truckin down the line, just past that neighbor, you're fine, give him that bright eye, a saaaaad smile, and know that we've all been walkin this same long mile. The voice is not a bandmember's.  Hunter and Kesey have been suggested but it sounds like neither.  The recitation is mildly mannered, and slightly suggestive of Dylan's phrasing in Clothesline Saga and other Basement Tapes.  Following these verses the Dead almost immediately dissolve the Jam and transit into the Main Ten.  The Jam in 4s shares thematic elements with the Main Ten.  Perhaps these verses are a first attempt at finding words to go with the Main Ten.  On the other hand, the recitation sounds improvised.  The identity of the speaker is a mystery still to solve.

The introduction centers on discussion of the free concert scheduled for December 6.  Originally the Dead were supposed to close this concert, headlined by the Rolling Stones, and including Santana, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jefferson Airplane, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  It was planned for Golden Gate Park, and the agreement was that the concert would be announced just a few days beforehand, to keep the park and city from being over-impacted.  When Mick Jagger announced the concert early to the press, San Francisco Parks & Recreation backed out.  As of 12/4 (as another announcement after Black Peter makes clear) concert planners thought they would be staging the show at Sears Point Raceway, but over the next 24 hours the site would be shifted a third and final time, to Altamont Speedway.

Harry Ely mastered this AUD tape.  He was a little fast on his pause button at this show.  He clips several songs and pauses three times during Drums.  Otherwise, he made quite a decent audience tape for '69 Dead. Jerry introduces Dire Wolf saying ""This is a song you can all sing along on"" and as it turned out ""Don't murder me, I beg of you, don't murder me"" was a good refrain at Altamont.  Jerry uses this intro the night before as well. The longest China Cat > Rider bridge Jam yet features a Caution tease from Phil among its divagations. The Uncle John's Jam is just a scrap from the song's Jam in 7s.  Apparently the previous night was the song's premier (there are Uncle John's Jams on 11/7 and 11/8) but as far as we know they didn't play the tune again till 12/12.  Given this taper's fast pause button finger, he's quite capable of having clipped the transition from Uncle John's Jam into the Main Ten, but unless he ran into serious trouble it's difficult to figure how he lost nearly the whole of Uncle John in a flip (he had a flip coming, probably, after Dire Wolf).  The evidence leaves it totally unclear whether they played the tune or just the Jam."

The sequence listed in SET 2 is probably not from the same set as the material listed in SET 1, though it is possible.  Which set came first is even more obscure. * Tapes of 12/11/69 & 12/12/69 have been in circulation for at least 25 years.  Often they used to be mislabeled ""Kaleidoscope Theater, LA,"" but the Thelma Theater venue was established as the correct labeling more than a dozen years ago and probably there are few tapes left now labeled with the wrong venue.  Parts of 12/11/69 still circulate mislabeled ""12/10/69,"" though, and other misdatings among the three shows also occur. * There is a 45-minute cassette side in circulation for at least 20 years often labeled ""Thelma Theater 12/10/69"" but sometimes also ""Thelma Theater 12/11/69,"" usually circulated in connection with other tapes from this run.  It begins with a copy of the 12/11/69 Dark Star which cuts immediately after ""transitive nightfall of diamonds"" and splices into the tape of That's It For The Other One > Cosmic Charlie listed in SET 2. This turns out _not_ to be the 12/11/69 sequence, as previously assumed.  T.C.'s keys make it '69, the long Drums date it to September or after, the expansive Jamming points to the end of the year, and the micing sounds like the other Thelma Theater tapes, so we might as well call it 12/10/69 since that is far the most plausible date under which it circulates.  On this tape, Cosmic Charlie breaks off after 23 seconds.  There is a strong Cosmic Charlie tease at 2:19 into the Cryptical reprise. Curiously, a substantial fragment of this That's It > Cosmic Charlie forms part of another of the oldest bogus tapes in circulation.  This tape has been around since the mid-70s at least, and goes by many names, including ""Haight St. 3/3/68 II"", ""Winterland 4/3/68"" and ""San Francisco 6/8/68.""  This 90-minute cassette consists of an unknown venue 1970 Good Lovin', followed by the San Diego 1/10/70 China Cat > Rider, Cold Rain and Hard To Handle, followed by the Avalon 4/6/69 That's It For The Other One > Death Don't.

The circulating soundboard cuts just as The Other One's last vocals are ending, and resumes immediately afterward near the beginning of Cosmic Charlie.  Though it's missing on the tape, it seems almost certain that they went on to play the Cryptical reprise before transitting into Cosmic Charlie.  Since this reprise varies from 2 minutes to 12 or more, it's difficult to say how much music is missing here. Dark Star cuts as they are gliding down toward the second vocals ; probably around 3-4 minutes are missing before the end of the tune.  After this cut the tape splices to the tag end of Alligator.  It is usually assumed that the set ran Dark Star > Alligator, but this is a short set as the circulating tape runs, even after adding 3 minutes of Dark Star and 4 of Alligator, and it seems possible that more than that is missing here. There is a tape flip at 1:40 into the following Drums, but little is lost here.  In the Jam in 8s out of The Eleven there are hints of Caution and of The Other One, but just hints.

Horrible noises seem to come from Phil's amp. The tape pauses here; it's not clear whether there was a full break between Hard To Handle and Long Black Limousine.  Long Black Limousine is Jerry and Bobby on acoustic guitars, Phil tries to play but drops out after his amp continues to sputter static.  Jerry switches to electric with Sawmill.  After The Race Is On Jerry announces that ""we're going to take a break within the break -- we're still working on Phil's bass frantically in the background."" Apparently the problem remained unsolved because when the next set begins it is still just Jerry and Bobby acoustic.  Pigpen does Katie Mae and Phil joins in on vocals for Cumberland.  Before Cumberland Jerry can be heard proposing that they do Cumberland first, then Uncle John to end the set.  The tape breaks off after Cumberland, however.  It seems possible that this represents the entire Dead performance for this date, although normally you'd expect more electric Dead.  Fleetwood Mac and The Flock were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

SET 2 transcribes a vault reel from this date.  It includes a copy of China Cat > Rider, plus the tunes listed in Set 2, apparently material that was not broadcast. In addition to the Dead's three tunes, the 60-minute cassette from the PBS broadcast includes the Airplane doing You, Me and Pooneil and Eskimo Blue Day, Santana doing Incident at Neshabur and Soul Sacrifice; and a Jam involving musicians from all the bands. SET 3 is from this Jam; it is already underway when the tape segment begins and the segment cuts before its conclusion.  Among musicians readily audible in this fragment of furious Jamming are Kaukonen, Garcia, Santana, Casady, Santana's rhythm section.  Besides the 60-minute cassette, video tape of the broadcast is also in circulation, and audio tapes dubbed from it."

Feb. 5-8, 1970) the Dead played one long set each night, as is clear from the tapes of 2/6/70 and as Michael Parrish, who attended the shows, confirms. Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on Seasons and The Race Is On. There are two different tapes from 2/5/70, a 31:07 minute AUD tape and a 42 minute SBD.  The first 5 songs listed are they AUD tape.  They appear as filler on the 2/08/70 AUD tape.  Probably Mason's Children follows Boss Man and Black Peter.  David Hollister, who finally sorted out the identity of Seasons and The Race Is On, thinks that they may belong after Mason's; my guess is they came before, but this is unclear from the tapes.  During the pause before Mason's Children various audience members call out for songs and Bobby responds ""Just relax and take what you get.""  Mason's plainly was not a set opener.  In the pause after Mason's the tuning sounds like Cryptical might be next, and I have supplemented the list from the tapes based on this assumption. The 41:43 SBD tape begins with the first 7:00 of Mason's Children, breaks off, then resumes with The Eleven already well under way.  Probably this is the conclusion of the show, and Uncle John was probably encore. DeadBase IX lists a China Cat > Rider as well.  Taj Mahal and Bigfoot were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

Garcia plays pedal steel guitar on the first 3 tunes.  On the AUD tape Green Grass cuts in on ""as I step down from the train.""  In the pause after Green Grass Jerry says with droll mock sarcasm ""And you thought you were gonna hear rock and roll."" -- probably Green Grass opened the set.  In the pause after Sawmill Jerry Teases Me And My Uncle repeatedly, but after a splice they play Seasons Of My Heart instead and when they do come around to Me And My Uncle, it's without the pedal steel.  In the pause after Seasons Garcia shifts to electric guitar and they ""test the monitors;"" in the lengthy pause before Boss Man they again try to get the monitors working properly; Bobby remarks on the ""jury-rigged house PA,"" observing that ""I hate to point the incriminating finger but I wish he'd leave his shit home."" We are fortunate to have a fairly decent AUD tape of the first hour of this show, since the circulating SBD is rather cut up, with an additional 40 seconds missing from the beginning of Green Grass, nearly a minute missing from the end of Sawmill, 30 seconds lost from the beginning of Seasons, 15 seconds clipped from the beginning of Big Boss Man, Hard To Handle missing entirely, and 45 seconds clipped from the beginning of Cold Rain And Snow.  On the other hand the circulating AUD breaks off after the first 4 seconds of Uncle John's Band, while the SBD carries on into Good Lovin'. For reference and comparison here is a timing of the circulating SBD:  Green Green Grass of Home [#3:39] ; [0:11] % [0:21] ; Sawmill [2:49#] % [0:06] % Seasons Of My Heart [#3:14] ; [2:01] ; China Cat Sunflower [3:11] > Jam [2:34] > I Know You Rider [4:15] > High Time [6:55] ; [0:31] % Big Boss Man [#4:45] ; [0:30] ; Me And My Uncle [3:11] ; [0:07] % Cold Rain And Snow [#4:46] > Uncle John's Band ... (timings from here on as above). Compared with Friday's total of 115 minutes and Sunday's of 138, the 85 minutes of Saturday 2/7/70 preserved on tape seems obviously to fall short by at least a half hour.  Obviously we are missing several tunes from the end of this set. Taj Mahal and Bigfoot were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

Bobby keeps singing Not Fade Away over the first 20 seconds of the Saint Stephen Jam; NFA is timed till the end of these vocals; the Stephen Reprise starts 20 seconds earlier and so actually runs 2:35, counting the overlap. On the set structure of these shows see 2/5/70 Comments. In his introduction Graham first presents ""Mr. Garcia"" with a ""photo of Michael J. Brody of RCA-Victor,"" and then gives this introduction:  ""Stars of stage, screen and radio, direct from a command performance in New Orleans, these are the Grateful Dead.""  Bobby explains the pause after Smokestack:  ""We're waitin' for the Bear to turn on his lovelight"" -- then, after a blast of Feedback, ""He just did.""  In the long tuning pause after Dire Wolf Phil Teases Lovelight and Jerry enjoins ""everybody just relax,"" several times. It is possible that one or more tunes are missing between It Hurts Me Too and Dark Star; it is also possible that nothing is missing here. The AUD tape has a cut at the end of Dark Star, in which the first 39 seconds of Saint Stephen are lost.  This looks like the taper taking the opportunity to flip; the AUD runs unbroken to the end of Lovelight after this cut. The SBD tape in circulation begins 3:42 before the end of Dark Star and runs for 33:04, cutting off 15:12 into Lovelight; the AUD supplies the remaining 19:55 of Lovelight.  This odd scrap, too, suggests there was something unusual about the dimensions of the set.  There is a passage of Tighten Up Jam during Lovelight. The AUD tape of 2/8/70 usually circulates as 2 90-minute cassettes with filler from 2/05/70 (Seasons, The Race Is On, Mason's, Boss Man, Peter).

The timings are from the AUD supplemented by the SBD.  The Allman Bros and Love were also on the bill. There are also two SBDs in circulation.  The one that has circulated for many years starts 10:23 minutes into the Dark Star, with the best copies breaking off 3:41 before the end of the Lovelight (or cutting to an AUD patch); however, most copies of the SBD in circulation break off about a minute earlier.  Usually the beginning of this tape is patched in from the AUD.  Recently a new copy of a SBD has come into circulation.  It includes the entire Late Show but at 6:58 into the Dark Star it has a cut in which 3:52 is missing; there are also copies of this SBD in circulation with this cut patched from the AUD.  It also has a cut at 30:16 of Lovelight, with 0:27 missing; this also can be patched from the AUD.  Probably the older circulating SBD comes from the surreptitious master (see below) while the recent copy comes from the vault master (this is speculation, however). TAPES FROM FILLMORE EAST FEBRUARY 1970 Reportedly it was during this Late Show that clever and industrious Fillmore East stagecrew members including John Chester and Alan Mande managed to patch a Revox reel-to-reel deck with 15-inch reels into the PA feed underneath the stage, and the moment when our circulating SBD tape picks up the Dark Star, 10:23 after its opening, is the moment when they managed to get their jury-rigged system up and running.  Circulating copies of this SBD master break off 3:41 before the end of the Lovelight; perhaps this cut is on the master.  In addition to this 45 minute from 2/11/70 our enterprising heroes taped the Late Shows on the 13th and 14th (but apparently not the Early Shows), and copies of these tapes have been in circulation since the early 70s. Bear also ran SBD masters of the 13th and 14th, and much of this material has now been released on Bear's Choice and Dick's Pick 4.  However, it is unclear whether there is any SBD from the 11th in the vault.  For the Dick's Picks 4 release, Jeffrey Norman patched gaps in the vault SBDs of the 13th and 14th using the surreptitious second SBD masters -- good karma all around.  The GD Records / Polygram Records CD, ""Allman Bros Band Fillmore East February 1970,"" (GDCD 4063) releases tape of the Allmans from this run and may contain tunes from this date. Recently, SBD tapes of the Early Shows from 2/13 and 2/14 have come into circulation, in FM and pre-FM copies. Besides the several SBDs from this run there are also two AUD tapes in circulation, one of the 2/11/70 Late Show and one of the 2/13/70 Early Show (see Comments under this date).  There is a complete copy of the 2/11/70 AUD master in circulation, and it also appears as patches for the first 10:23 of the Dark Star and last 3:41 of the Lovelight, otherwise missing on the older circulating SBD tape, and in patches of the missing 3:52 starting at 6:58 of the more recently circulated SBD.  The AUD of the 2/13/70 Early Show could easily be by the same taper as the 2/11/70 AUD.  Both tapes have strong saturation and strong bass, and both have decent but not perfect mic placement, and as a result boomy in the bass with considerable hall resonance and audience noise.  There is no evidence of AUD tape from the 14th in circulation.

If this is correct then as far as we know there is no tape currently in circulation of the 3/20/70 Early Show. The Village Voice ad for the March 20 & 21 Capitol Theater shows lists the Dead, with Catfish opening, shows at 8:00 and 11:00.  The Early Shows appear to have consisted of a 70-minute electric set; presumably Catfish played an opening set.  It isn't clear whether they also opened the Late Show.  The Dead's Late Show set was considerably longer than the Early Show's, with a short acoustic mini-set inserted in the middle.

The tape cuts in on the beginning of Good Lovin', losing around 90 seconds; the Lovelight is virtually intact; some copies do not have the unnecessary tapeflip, which represents a pathetic bit of malicious mischief.

Miles Davis contributed an hour-long set each evening, and according to DeadBase Stone The Crows and Clouds were also on the bill. The AUD tape was mastered by Harry Ely.  Some copies in circulation have the last couple minutes of Deep Elem Blues cut, others don't. ""Cowboy Song"" is an Instrumental improvisation involving audience participation on a hoe-down type riff with an unknown vocalist conducting in a sort of scat & yodel fashion (it isn't Marmaduke or Ramblin Jack or David Bromberg -- maybe it's Nelson on acid?); this one-time-only affair never had a name -- the title comes from tape labels. The Other One Drums sound like they were cut out on the spot with the pause button. Quite a bit of Lovelight is missing, probably; Pigpen is only just starting to get wound up when the circulating AUD cuts.

SET 1 may be the complete acoustic Dead set, though it's possible songs are missing before Rider.  Broken string comment/delay before Dark Star.  Over the applause following Uncle John Jerry says ""we're gonna bring on the electric Dead.""  According to Bill Ray, who attended the show, there was definitely a set break, and Stu Green, who produced the show, confirms this.  He adds: ""My main impression of the audiences those nights was that they came expecting Live Dead and (at least for the opening sets) got Workingman's Dead.  I remember that during the intermission people were kind of real smiley and saying 'Wow, the Dead are playing folk music!'  Pigpen was frail and jaundiced, and had to rest in the dressing room during parts of the shows.""  Spencer Wren, another audience member, recalls that Hammond opened, followed by NRPS with Jerry on pedal steel and Phil playing bass. SET 2 is electric Dead.  It may be that a tune or two featuring Bobby's vocals or Pigpen's is missing in the splices before and after Dire Wolf.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting about 13 minutes into Dark Star.  The Jam during which the reel audibly runs out sounds like it's heading for Good Lovin'.  According to Wren, Pigpen and Hammond came out and Jammed by way of an encore after the Dead finished their electric set, around 1:30 AM. The Eleven analyzes   Saint Stephen > 1st vocals 1:05 > transition Jam 2:19 > Eleven Jam 3:08  > Eleven vocals 0:40 > Eleven Jam 4:57  > Eleven 2nd theme Jam 1:46 > Drums. This tape's fidelity leaves something to be desired for the first few minutes but by the beginning of Friend Of The Devil the taper gets his levels up (the PA levels come up during Rider) and thereafter this is fairly decent AUD tape, not dead on in the sweet spot but quite listenable.  It's possible the mics were repositioned before the electric set and/or before Dark Star.  Bill Ray reports that John Hammond opened. All of the listed tunes except the concluding fragment of Man's World have been in circulation for many years dated ""4/24/70.""  Recently the Man's World fragment came into circulation, labeled as part of this same tape.  This list, however, strikingly resembles the list in the review of the next night (see Comments under 4/25/70), particularly with the addition of Man's World.  On the other hand the eyewitnesses appear to vouch for this list as the 24th.  Perhaps the show reviewed is misdated, or perhaps there is a mix-up in the dating of this tape, or of the fragment of Man's World."

There may have been a second electric Dead set as well.  Obviously none of this is complete.  (1) Marmaduke says goodnight. The NRPS set conclusion occurs at the beginning of a cassette which continues with the 5/2/70 NRPS set.  Apparently this derives from a band work tape. After Uncle John Jerry says ""we'll come back with our electric stuff in just a moment,"" Bobby interjects ""you wanna hear Pigpen?"" and Jerry responds ""Pigpen doesn't wanna do anything."" The newly circulating transcription of this SBD contains the Dead sets listed above.  The old SBD fragment of this show circulated for years mislabeled ""St. Louis 5/19/70;"" it's total time is 37:02; it cuts in on the concluding 9:38 of The Other One, probably soon after Drums, and runs through to the end of Cryptical, then cuts to High Time; the Lovelight fragment follows after another splice; circulating copies tend to be very fast.  Between this tape and the initial 19 seconds of The Other One on the newer tape, probably little of The Other One is missing. A to Latvala there is no tape in the vault for this show.

Speaking to Dick Lawson in England around 5/24/70, Garcia said: ""We're going through some transitions. Our music is not what it was: it's continually changing. What we've been doing in the States lately is having like 'an evening with the Grateful Dead.' We start off with acoustic music with Bobby and I playing guitars, light Drums and very quiet electric bass. Pigpen plays the organ. Then we have a band we've been travelling with, The New Riders of the Purple Sage, where I play pedal steel, not guitar, Mickey plays Drums, and three of our friends from the coast, musicians that we've known for a long time, are fronting the band. So we start off with acoustic muisc and then The New Riders of the Purple Sage -- it's like very snappy electric country-rock; it's kinda hard to describe -- and then we come on with the electric Dead, so it keeps us all really interesting, and it's six hours of this whole development thing. By the end of the night it's very high.""

At one point there is an announcement that the first aid station has eyedrops for people still smarting from teargas at a demonstration that afternoon in New Haven; the tape ends with a speaker urging participation in the next day's nationwide protests against the Viet Nam War.  The end of the Good Lovin' Jam features Phil soloing with the drummers.  Bobby plays acoustic on New Speedway.

These timings represent a composite of the two circulating AUD masters.  On the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments under 05/02/70b.  SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  (1) Monitor check after I Know You Rider Jerry plays electric guitar on Cumberland and New Speedway Boogie, while Bobby continues on acoustic guitar.  Apparently David Nelson adds a second acoustic guitar to New Speedway and perhaps Cumberland, since Bobby & Jerry both introduce him after New Speedway; it is very difficult to pick out his guitar on the circulating tapes, however. SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel.  The cut in Fair Chance To Know is the tape flip; it's harder to figure what happened with the cut before Seasons -- it may not be on the master.  Somebody adds soaring harmony vocals to Last Lonely Eagle.  The Race Is On, Seasons, Mama Tried and Sawmill feature vocals by ""special guest star Bobby Ace, formerly of Bobby Ace And The Cards Off The Bottom."" SET 3 is electric Dead.  By way of introduction to Dire Wolf Jerry says ""This is a little paranoid-in-the-streets mantra -- if you want to think of it that way.""  Beat It On Down The Line gets 30 beats in response to an audience-member's reply to the question ""What's a good number?"" -- at first this query elicits cries for ""Alligator"" & Jerry replies ""He didn't mean that kind of number.  He meant the other kind of number -- you know, 'one, two...' .""  The Jam after the Darkness Jam includes hints of NFA, Lovelight, Caution and the Saint Stephen Jam.  There was no encore. Together the two circulating AUD masters from this show present us with that rare thing, a recording of the (nearly) complete sequence of events at your typical mid-1970 3-set show (acoustic Dead - NRPS - electric Dead) -- and a generous high-energy show at that.  Circulating copies of the more nearly complete AUD master contain the entire show except a few cuts and glitches; notably, this master has several cuts in the NRPS set (listed above), is missing the first couple bars of Easy Wind, loses levels late in this tune, and is missing The Frozen Logger and the first 2:05 of the Drums > Not Fade Away.  There are at least two different copies of this master in circulation, one that's been around for more than a decade, marked by its omission of the NRPS set, and the other, apparently from a much more recent retranscription of the master, which includes the NRPS set.  The more complete version tends to be cleaner as well; the other glitches are on both copies & presumably on the master. The circulating copy of the second AUD master contains 70 minutes of excerpts from the electric Dead set, (#Cold Rain; Dire Wolf; Easy Wind; Beat It; High Time; That's It > Cosmic Charlie; I'm A King Bee; The Frozen Logger; and Not Fade Away, which breaks off near the end); this is sufficient to cover all the electric set flaws on the first master but offers no help with the NRPS set.  Both masters make very listenable AUD tape.  The mics for the more nearly complete master were placed further back; it has more audience noise on it, including the group among whom it was recorded, who have quite an amusing party but manage to be quiet during songs.  The 70 minute excerpts tape has much less audience noise, and a crisp bass; the mics were much closer in, and this tape sometimes circulates mislabeled ""SBD."""

According to Chris Cole who attended this show it was an afternoon show and among the tunes played were Hard To Handle and The Other One.

On the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments under 05/02/70b.  SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  Throughout the first five tunes they are plagued by monitor sound problems and the pauses between songs are full of efforts to fix them.  After Candyman Bobby says ""Jerry broke a string, and so, we're gonna do some more relaxin'.""  On the circulating tape this is followed by a splice, after which Sam Cutler comes up on the PA and says ""Can Bob Matthews come up on stage and sort out the sound system which isn't working.""  After another splice the NRPS set opener follows (SET 2).  It's hard to guess whether there are acoustic tunes missing after Candyman.  The NRPS set is substantially complete except for most of Henry and most of The Weight.  (Some copies have the 5/1/70 SBD Little Susie and Uncle John's as fill on II B -- not to be mistaken for part of the missing acoustic set of 5/14/70.) SET 2 is the NPRS set with Garcia, pedal steel.  After Whatcha Gonna Do someone asks Jerry if it's OK, then announces ""Alright we're gonna open the back doors and let everybody else in free.""  Monitor level problems continue during this set.  (1) Marmaduke introduces Henry as ""our dope-smuggler song -- it's a fantasy.""  The tape cuts 33 seconds into this tune; when the signal resumes they are yet again trying to get the monitors and PA working right.  Marmaduke wonders if the theatrical lighting is drawing power off the PA & suggests turning it down.  2 minutes later they restart Henry but this version too fades down incomplete.  After another splice Garden Of Eden begins.  After Lodi the drummer starts Honky Tonk Women but the band doesn't follow, he drops it, they pause, then start The Weight instead (which cuts off after only 13 seconds on the circulating tapes).  Both tunes were set-closers for NRPS; they might have closed this set with The Weight or gone on to close with Honkytonk.  These various cuts aside (some arising from technical difficulties at the show), the tape in circulation appears to represent a complete set.  It seems possible the master includes the rest of The Weight. SET 3 is electric Dead.  There are two circulating sources for this show's electric set, an 80 minute SBD and a 45 minute FM-SBD.  The 45 FM-SBD contains Casey Jones % China Cat > Rider % Mama Tried > High Time % Good Lovin' % Good Morning Little Schoolgirl.  The 80 minute circulating SBD tape has the entire electric set except China Cat > Rider, Good Lovin', and Dire Wolf, with the sequence of tunes misarranged before Cold Rain.  David Gans reports this sequence as the contents of vault reels 3, 4 & 5. The encore is with David Nelson, mandolin, and Marmaduke, bass vocals; it does not appear on the circulating tapes.

On Cumberland and New Speedway David Nelson joins in on acoustic guitar while Jerry shifts to electric.  On Cold Jordan Nelson switches to mandolin.  Marmaduke adds harmony vocals to the last three tunes.  Pigpen plays organ on New Speedway.  SET 2 is the Early Show NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel.  Everything after the Last Lonely Eagle fragment is missing on the surreptitious master of this show.  Evidently it has been supplemented from another master on the newly circulating Cds, which now add different versions of the tunes following Eagle.  One wonders if this other master could also complete the Eagle, which usually features a big pedal steel solo.  SET 3 is electric Dead.  Before Saint Stephen Pigpen says ""Alright you people, you know who you are."" Enterprising Fillmore East stagecrew patched a reel-to-reel machine underneath the stage into the PA feed and saved most of this show for us and eternity.  They were busy setting up for the Early Show electric Dead set and blew their flip during the Early Show NRPS set, losing the second half of that set as a result, but the rest of this enormous evening's proceedings are recorded in their entirety.  The master has only the left channel through the middle of Candyman (there are also splitter-generated 2-channel mono copies circulating).  Around 4 hours of this show were broadcast by KPFA-FM Berkeley in 1971, further speeding the propagation of this tape (some early FM copies are dated ""6/21/71;"" this may be the date of the broadcast).  For many years 5/15/70 was THE representative 1970 Dead tape -- Harpur College 5/2/70 and Winterland Arena 10/4/70 its only rivals for wide circulation.  Recently a version of the NRPS set for this Early Show has come into circulation, as noted above, apparently supplemented by a second SBD master, presumably from the vault."

David Nelson plays mandolin on A Voice From On High and Marmaduke adds bass vocals.  SET 2 is the complete Late Show NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel.  Bob Weir guests on vocals for Mama Tried, Sawmill and Me And My Uncle.  There is a brief cut in Sawmill, with less than 10 seconds lost.  After this set the master contains 15:13 of continuing signal, comprising parts of Side B of Abbey Road (playing on the PA during the break) interspersed with the sounds of the stage being rigged -- Drums nailed down, etc -- followed by the sounds of tuning up.  SET 3 is electric Dead.  (1) Bill Graham Intro. Beat It On Down The Line gets 14 beats.  In the pause after Next Time You See Me Pigpen says, in response to an audience request for Alligator, ""Don't be hollerin no emergency warnings in a place like this.  An alligator in here could chomp off a buncha feet.""  Phil meanwhile is teasing Dark Star.  Just before the cassette side cuts off, Jerry Teases the introductory riff of Attics.  When the tape resumes on the next cassette Dark Star begins.  From the tape it's impossible to tell whether or not in the interval they repeated Attics from the Early Show but it seems likelier that they didn't.  There is a cut 2:17 into Saint Stephen; probably around 60 - 90 seconds are missing here.  There is a cut 13:33 into Lovelight, but probably only a few seconds are lost.  Over the last year it has been rumored that there is another SBD master of this show in the vault, which includes the rest of the Early Show NRPS set (and which would probably allow us to patch the few other glitches on the circulating master); however, nothing has emerged besides rumors thus far.  Meanwhile, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to those resourceful Fillmore East crewmembers who took the bull by the horns and MADE TAPE.  Muchas Garcias, guys.

A bit more than a minute into the Attics someone (Phil?) can be heard in the left channel calling out ""E -- E chord"" to Pigpen -- Attics was still new.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting about 3:30 into Dark Star.  There is a Dancin Tease at 18:03 into Dark Star.  There is a cut 23:16 into the Lovelight on the AUD, probably a tape flip, with 20-40 seconds lost.  The AUD tape contains the complete show.  The newly circulating SBD of the entire show has the first 30 seconds of Casey Jones clipped.  It also has a cut at 3:24 of Saint Stephen, with 26 seconds missing. This was the Dead's first overseas show (they played Canada in '67).  There is said to be film of at least part of this set in existance.

3044,1970,1970-06-24,Grateful Dead,Capitol Theater,"Port Chester , NY",6/24/70a,[4:57] ; Intro [1:13] % New Minglewood Blues [3:44],"Total time 69:09 +.  Early Show.  As far as we know this tape only circulates labeled ""Capitol Theater, Port Chester 3/20/70 Early Show.""  However, Gary Lambert notices that the Intro on the tape (by the show's producer, Howard Stein) goes ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Capitol is proud to have back ... The Grateful Dead"" -- and points out that the shows on March 20 and 21st were the Dead's first run at this venue, the June shows their return.  Dwight Holmes has studied solos from this tape in comparison with other performances from Spring and from Summer, and says this supports dating the tape to June.  The Good Lovin', too, is more suggestive of June than March.  Altogether the case seems strong for re-dating this tape, and we now list it here as the June 24 Early Show electric set.  It would still be nice to turn up corroborating evidence.The Capitol Theater's ads for the Dead shows on 6/24/70 read:  ""Wednesday, June 24  |  8 PM & Midnight / 3 hours with  |  GRATEFUL DEAD  |  Alone with no other act.""  Apparently in June the New Riders weren't yet considered an ""other act,"" since we have one of their sets from the evening -- and indeed at this point, with Jerry on pedal steel full time and Phil & one of the drummers often taking part as well, and Bobby a more than occasional guest vocalist, the two bands were not yet completely differentiated.  It is clear from the tapes that the Late Show on June 24th consisted of the classic 3-set Dead show of mid-70 (acoustic Dead -- NRPS -- electric Dead).  It is not clear whether the Early Show also had this structure or whether it consisted solely of a single electric set -- the tape listed here.  (It is just possible that the fragment of a NRPS set listed below as from the Late Show is actually from the Early.)This is quite a good job of AUD taping.  There is a tape-flip 9:51 into the Good Lovin' sequence; side B begins with the concluding vocals and runs 1:21; probably less than a minute is lost here and probably this flip is not on the master.  It also seems likely that the master contains a complete copy of the encore."

SET 1 is acoustic Dead. (1) Whooping contest.  ""Pigpen's off making friends with some honey.""  Introduction. Pigpen's harmonica is prominent on several tunes.  Jerry plays electric guitar on Cumberland Blues.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Cold Jordan and Marmaduke adds bass vocals.  It's probable there are songs missing in the splices between songs during the 2nd half of the set and after Cold Jordan.  The first 5 songs also circulate labeled ""3/20/70 Early Show;"" this seems very unlikely, however -- see Comments under 3/20/70a.  SET 2 is the first 8 songs of a NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel; we are missing 2-8 more songs to conclude the set.  The taper has trouble with his mics at several points (notice the cuts, too) and this may be all of the set this taper managed to record.  Probably this is the same taper as the acoustic set, but he has moved his mics.  The acoustic set is a fairly decent job of taping, but this approaches prime. SET 3 is an electric set.  (2) Mountain Jam tuning. This could be the complete set or possibly one or more songs could be missing after Me And My Uncle.  It sounds as if the mics were moved before Dark Star; after Me And My Uncle the recording is truly excellent.  There is a Tighten Up Jam in Dark Star before Sugar Mag.  Phil starts to go into High Time at the end of Rider but pulls up short immediately.  It seems clear they ended the set here, however.  (3) 2nd Encore.  After the first encore lengthy cheering over Judy Collins' recording of Richard Farina's Pack Up Your Sorrows playing on the PA finally yields a second encore. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is acoustic Dead with Marmaduke bass vocals & David Nelson, mandolin.

See Might As Well for a response (the title quotes Janis).  Reportedly there are 100 hours of raw film footage from the tour in process of being edited into a feature documentary.  The 2 songs in circulation come from video tape from this footage.  Don't Ease is acoustic; New Speedway is electric and features Pigpen's harmonica.  David Galbraith, an audience member, recalls that NRPS opened and that the Dead's set included Lovelight and Casey Jones.  SBD of Janis's awesome set from Toronto 6/27/70 is in circulation.  There is said to be a video tape of film from this show in circulation containing an All Star Jam including Jerry & Billy performing CC Rider, and the Dead performing a version of Easy Wind, and a version of Candyman."

Howard Mott, who atended this show, notes that it was part of a 2-day festival, with Janis and the Band playing on the 4th.  On the 3rd, he remembers the Dead-NRPS show running about 4 hours in all.  Eric Anderson was one of the opening acts.  He remarks that Bobby and Phil as well as Jerry took part in the NRPS set.  The tunes listed are the titles he recalls.  Lovelight was of course the set closer. According to Ihor Slabicky circulating video tape copies of Festival Express film footage show the Don't Ease from this show (daytime) , the New Speedway Boogie (electric), and the Hard To Handle.  The video also contains a C.C. Rider from this show (nightime) from an all-star Jam.  Slabicky lists personnel as follows:  Garcia is playing his red Gibson, Kreutzmann on tambourine, Sylvia Tyson of The Great Speckled Bird on vocals with other members of this band Jim Colegrove on bass, Buddy Cage on pedal steel, N.D. Smart on Drums, and Amos Garrett on lead guitar, Delaney Bramlett on guitar, the organ player from Delaney and Bonnie's group, and Ian Tyson on acoustic guitar.  C.C. Rider is followed by Will The Circle Be Unbroken, with Bonnie Bramlett on vocals. It has been claimed that there was a free concert following this show during which Janis joined the Dead for Lovelight.  Perhaps the all-star Jam Slabicky refers to comes from this free concert, since he identifies it as night-time footage.The circulating SBD of Janis's set from Toronto 6/27/70 has as filler two songs listed as from a Calgary 7/4/70 show.Dwight Holmes reports that he waited in line for a show at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago on 7/5/70, where it was announced around 5:00 PM that the Dead had cancelled."

Easy Wind is probably from the 9th; it differs from the versions circulating for the other nights of the run.  The intro prefixed proves it an opener.  Workin' Man Blues, which precedes it on the circulating tape, may therefore also belong to the 9th, but could come from the 10th or 12th.  FOTD could be either the 9th or the 10th.  SET 1 is from an acoustic Dead set, SET 2 from the NRPS set, possibly the opener, and SET 3 the opener of the electric Dead set. David Ross recalls attending a show from this run, apparently the 9th.  He remembers that among other songs they played ""a Dire Wolf with Jerry on pedal steel guitar during one of the acoustic sets, and an Uncle John's Band...  a Casey Jones, a Dark Star and a Morning Dew.""  His phrase, ""one of the acoustic sets,"" probably reflects how difficult it was to tell the acoustic Dead sets from NRPS in 1970. The four July 70 Fillmore East shows were ""Midnight Shows.""  The concert started at midnight each night and consisted of an acoustic Dead set, a NRPS set, and an electric set.  DeadBase IX gives this (obviously incomplete) list for the 9th:  [acoustic]  Silver Threads And Golden Needle; Cumberland Blues; Dire Wolf; Swing Low Sweet Chariot; [electric]  Easy Wind; Casey Jones; Not Fade Away > Good Lovin'; Viola Lee Blues; Morning Dew; Sittin' On Top Of The World; Uncle John's Band."

Often copies have Around And Around from 11/8/70 and Oh Boy from 4/6/71 following Cosmic Charlie for filler on one side, and an unknown venue electric Big Railroad Blues from late 1970 for filler on the other side following Good Lovin'.

See Comments under 07/09/70 on the structure of this show.  This list and the timings are based on Kenny Schachat's AUD tape of the show; his mics were about 15 rows back in the center orchestra and the tapes are in the A minus range for the period.  As often on masters from this period, tape pauses between nearly every tune (""to save batteries"").  There are also copies of another master in circulation, containing the second half of the acoustic set, and nearly all the electric set with the sequence completely scrambled.  Circulating copies are higher generation and it's difficult to tell how kind the master itself might sound.  The New Minglewood Blues appearing at the end of Side A of the 1st cassette of the 2nd AUD master is actually filler from 7/10/70.  Bart Wise says that R.T.Carlyle mastered one of the AUDs for this date, so perhaps this 2nd AUD master is his. SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Rosalie McFall, A Voice From On High, Cold Jordan and Swing Low Sweet Chariot.  Jerry plays electric guitar on New Speedway, but Bobby still acoustic.  So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad) is an Everly Brothers tune.  Marmaduke contributes bass vocals to the gospel tunes. SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel.  This seems a little short to be the complete set, but at 2:00 AM apparently it was. SET 3 is the electric Dead set, apparently complete.  The Not Fade Away is expansively Jammed out.  There are Mountain Jam allusions around 6:00 and for several minutes starting around 8:00 they weave The Other One in and out of Not Fade. In the last couple years some people have argued that our tapes and lists for 7/11/70 and 7/12/70 are switched.  As I see it the strongest evidence against this argument is that there are two different AUD masters in circulation, both generally labeled ""7/11/70.""   It is for this reason that I believe our tapes and lists for these dates are correct as given here. There is at least one bogus tape in circulation mislabeled with this venue & date."

David Crosby plays 12-string guitar on Cumberland and New Speedway, and Jerry plays electric on these tunes.  The best tapes of this set supplement the vault SBD of the acoustic set by patching in a truly excellent AUD which supplies Don't Ease, Cumberland and New Speedway.  The AUD Don't Ease is patched in before Friend Of The Devil.  After the SBD Deep Elem Blues there is a splice, followed by 0:04 from the beginning of a SBD version of New Speedway, followed by another splice, followed by the AUD Cumberland, another splice and then the AUD New Speedway.  Besides these patches there is no other sign of this AUD tape in circulation.  The AUD master is certainly good enough to be Bear's. SET 2 is electric Dead.  Before El Paso Jerry says ""OK now here's where Weir gets his wish, at the expense of everybody.""  Most of Easy Wind is cut.  There is a cut at 1:57 of the Good Lovin' Reprise, with considerable Jamming lost.  David Crosby, NRPS, and Rubber Duck Company with Tom Constanten were also on the bill (DeadBase IX).

Sometimes it circulates labeled ""Bobby Ace & the Cards Off the Bottom of the Deck, Studio, 1970."" Weir seems to be in charge.  Before Let Me In Bobby says ""Let's do that slow number.  If you feel like cryin', why, just go ahead.""  The tape cuts off with Bobby saying ""Leave that door open, or I'll kill ya."" On the 2400 Fulton Street list the following comments from Pete Sears appear:  ""in 1971, John Cippolina and I were forming Copperhead and John introduced me to Jerry and we played together on the first KSAN radio broadcast in their record library on the Richard Gossett show with Jerry on pedal steel, John on guitar, Mario on bass, Bob Weir on vocals and rythmn guitar, and I played piano."" 1971 seems a tad late, though possible, for this tape, and also for the ""first"" KSAN broadcast, but Sears' description does sound like this tape.  On the other hand Michael Parrish contends that this comes from August '69.  Plainly we need some fresh, solid evidence."

SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  The tape containing the timed tunes usually circulates as unidentified filler, but a few copies bear this date, which seems plausible.  Someone shouts for Kesey before Let Me In, which produces a mocking comment from Phil; the vibe strongly suggests the Fillmore West. DeadBase IX lists a Casey Jones for this date.  Set 2 was a NRPS set and SET 3 was electric dead.  There is a review of this show by Michael Lydon posted on the Rolling Stone website.  The untimed tunes are from the review. Teddy GoodBear and Dave Tamarkin strongly dissent from this dating of the tape.  They point out that the best copies they've located appear as filler on Ken Leigh's NYC area AUD masters.  They believe that this tape is probably Ken's master from a show in fall '70 in the NYC area.  They may be correct. ""Grateful Dead I Have Known,"" by Ed McClanahan (Playboy, March 72), is based on this run of shows.  He doesn't get all the details right (or necessarily mean to -- he doesn't aim to publish a setlist) and it's definitely self-indulgent writing in the manner of Hunter Thompson & Tom Wolfe, but he does catch a hint of the flavor of the venue and the event, if from a tourist's point of view.

On the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments under 05/02/70b.  SET 1 is acoustic Dead.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Friend Of The Devil, Dark Hollow, Tell It To Me, Rosalie McFall, Cold Jordan and Swing Low.  Pigpen plays piano on How Long Blues, Candyman, Ripple, Truckin', and New Speedway.  There's a hint of harmonica at the beginning of Ripple; it seems too discreet to be Pigpen's.  Jerry plays electric guitar on Cumberland and New Speedway while Bobby continues acoustic.  Marmaduke provides bass vocal accompaniment on Cold Jordan and Swing Low.  It seems probable that this set as listed is missing a tune from Pigpen (compare Operator the previous night).  This set was preceded starting at 8:00 by an unbilled opening set from a bluegrass vocals quartet, possibly the Rowan Bros. SET 2 is from the NRPS set with Garcia, pedal steel, and possibly Lesh on bass.  Six Days On The Road opened the set and The Weight followed by Honky Tonk Women closed the set, which included a half dozen more tunes from the first NRPS album.  The 3 tunes circulating on tape mis-labeled from this set (a fragmentary Six Days, Whatcha Gonna Do, and Glendale Train) are actually from 8/18/70. SET 3 is electric Dead.  The introduction goes:  ""Out of the backwoods of Marin County, sometimes known as the Kodiak Woodchuck Motherfuckers, The Grateful Dead!""  After Easy Wind Jerry announces ""the first broken string in this set.""  Sugar Magnolia concludes without Sunshine Daydream.  The third guitar in Not Fade > Lovelight is probably David Crosby.  ""Excuse me, young lady, would you like to fuck?"" is the approach Pigpen recommends around 12 minutes into this epic Lovelight -- then, at the end, ""See y'all later.""  There was no encore. The best copies of this show currently circulating have the following lineage: MAC > R @ 7.5 ips > R @ 3.75 ips > PCM/Beta > DAT Unfortunately this transcription contains only the Dead sets.  The 12 minutes of NRPS from this date circulates separately on a cassette of unknown lineage.  We need a fresh transcription of these masters.

Set 1 is acoustic Dead, perhaps the complete set (though the AUD in circulation is missing most of Swing Low).  The tape begins with Truckin', which has a piano loud in the PA mix; this is halted after 18 seconds by Garcia's shouts of ""Hold it!  Monitors!  We won't play without the monitors.""  During the following banter Phil proposes ""If you got a yellow dog bring him up here and we'll screw him.""  When they restart Truckin' Garcia calls out over its opening ""Bring the piano down!"" and it comes down in the PA mix over the next 20 seconds or so.  Pigpen also plays piano on Brokedown Palace and Box Of Rain.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Dark Hollow, Friend Of The Devil, Ripple, Rosalie McFall, Cold Jordan and Swing Low.  Jerry plays pedal steel guitar and someone plays fiddle on Box Of Rain. Set 2 is the beginning of the NRPS set.  We must be missing at least another half dozen songs or so to make up the complete set.  Probably the rest of the set exists on the AUD masters. Set 3 is electric Dead, the conclusion of the show; probably this was preceded by at least a few more electric tunes.  This is one of the major Dark Stars of the year.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting around 18:00 minutes in to Dark Star.  About 3 minutes after the 2nd Drums in Good Lovin' Phil trios with the drummers for a minute or so. This is a listenable AUD tape, mastered by Jack Toner on a Sony T-110 cassette deck; the mics are a ways back in the hall but the band is still decently audible and the audience noise is miraculously minimal for the venue.  Most circulating copies are missing the opening 0:28 of the Dark Star; some are missing the last 0:37 of Good Lovin', but complete copies also circulate. It seems probable that much more of this show exists on the AUD masters than is presently circulating or cataloged here (10/00).  It would be nice to bring them into circulation complete.  See Comments under 9/18/70 on the SBDs of this run. THE STRUCTURE OF THE SEPTEMBER 1970 FILLMORE EAST SHOWS The Fillmore East ad in the Village Voice for 9/10/70 (p. 44) lists ""one show per night at 10, Sunday at 8"" ""by the Grateful Dead featuring NRPS, with Joe's Lights,"" nightly from Thursday 9/17 through Sunday 9/20.  Each show during this run consisted of an acoustic Dead set, a NRPS set, and an electric Dead set; on the structure of mid-70 Dead shows see Comments under 05/02/70b."

Timings are from the AUD tape supplemented by the SBD.  See Comments under 9/17/70 on the structure of this show. Set 1 is acoustic Dead.  Pigpen plays piano on Truckin'.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Black Peter.  During Black Peter, after ""Go beneath the ground,"" Jerry stops the song cold, saying (in his most serious voice) ""Hold it.  This is insane, man.  I'm sorry but it's just horrible up here.  Really awful.""  Compare the previous night's false start of Truckin'.  This time, though, they decide to abort the acoustic set and move directly to NRPS set, which is why this NRPS set is so long. Set 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel guitar.  This is probably the complete set.  Bobby is featured vocalist on The Race Is On, Mama Tried and Sawmill. Set 3 is an electric Dead set, probably complete.  The first 15 seconds of Casey Jones are clipped on the circulating AUD tape.  There are speed glitches on the master during the first Cryptical produced by the deck being jostled as someone passes; this problem recurs at several points during the set.  In the pause before Dancin one of the drummers starts the Not Fade drum pattern and then pulls up short after one round when the band doesn't follow -- ""Aw, no dice"" is the taper's comment.  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting about 9 minutes in to Dancin'.  There is a cut in the AUD tape's Saint Stephen starting at 3:29; approximately 40 seconds are missing here -- probably a tape flip.  The Jam out of Not Fade Away starts teasing Goin' Down The Road early on but never resolves into it either before or after a fairly developed Bid You Goodnight Jam.  For the first 1:02 after the Good Lovin' Drums Phil solos with the drummers.  The demonstration demanding an encore goes on over the Youngblood's version of Get Together playing on the PA. Jack Toner mastered the circulating audience cassette source.  This AUD master makes decent listening, especially the electric Dead set.  The mics aren't right up front but they're not as far back in the hall as on 9/17/70 so the tape has better saturation and presence, and the audience noise isn't much worse. The 80 minute SBD in circulation contains Truckin', Peter, and Me & My Uncle through the encore.  The FM-SBD contains Me & My Uncle through the encore.. SBD TAPES OF THE SEPTEMBER 1970 FILLMORE EAST SHOWS As they did in February and May '70, enterprising Fillmore East stagecrew patched a reel-to-reel deck under the stage into the PA feed and made SBD masters of the September '70 Fillmore East run.  It is not clear how much of the run they managed to master.  At present (10/00) no SBD tape from 9/17/70 has emerged into circulation but this does not mean that no masters exist.  Several years ago about 50 minutes of SBD excerpts from the 9/18/70 electric Dead set (Operator through the encore) came into circulation, initially as FM-SBD broadcast by David Gans.  During the same period approximately 70 minutes of SBD excerpts from the 9/19/70 electric Dead set came into circulation in the same fashion.  Two SBD cassettes from 9/20/70 have been in circulation for more than 20 years; they contain both the acoustic and electric Dead sets nearly complete but nothing of the NRPS set.  Recently a lower gen copy of these tapes have come into circulation (see Comments under 9/20/70). Much of this run of shows has not yet emerged into circulation on SBD tape.  To judge from the nearly complete SBD of 5/15/70 made by the same tapers, it seems plausible to think that all four September shows were taped in their entirety, including the NRPS sets.  Whatever these masters contain, they are not in the vault; they are said to reside on the East Coast.

Timings are from the AUD tape supplemented by the SBD.  See Comments under 9/17/70 on the structure of this show. Set 1 is acoustic Dead, probably the complete set.  David Nelson plays mandolin on Deep Elem Blues, Rosalie McFall, Cold Jordan and Swing Low; Marmaduke sings bass harmony on Cold Jordan and Swing Low.  Apparently Jerry plays piano on To Lay Me Down.  He plays electric guitar on Cumberland and New Speedway.  Tapes of this set circulate in two parts.  Don't Ease through New Speedway circulates separately, sometimes mis-labeled ""9/18/70"".  The last three acoustic tunes circulate with the 9/19/70 electric set AUD. Set 2 is NRPS, probably the complete set. Set 3 is electric Dead, the complete set.  A ripe Dark Star, definitely, but the 17th is the first magnitude Star of the run.  This is the Lovelight in which Bobby (at 10:45 or so) asks the immortal quesion ""Pigpen, did you say 'fuck'?""  Afterward, Pigpen dismisses the audience's cheering demand for an encore with the rhetorical question ""Why don't you guys go home and fuck somebody!"" The SBD and FM-SBD contain Dark Star through Lovelight; the AUDs contain the entire list.  See Comments under 9/18/70 on the SBDs of this run.

See Comments under 9/17/70 on the structure of this show. SET 1 is acoustic Dead, the complete set.  David Grisman plays mandolin on Friend Of The Devil, David Nelson joins with another mandolin on Big Railroad Blues; both continue through Ripple.  There is a hint of harmonica on Dark Hollow, presumably Pigpen's.  The instrumentation on To Lay Me Down is hard to figure but the electric guitar is probably Bobby and Jim Wise may be right that the piano is Jerry on this tune.  The piano on Truckin' is Pigpen, however.  Nelson & Grisman return on mandolin for Rosalie McFall.  Jerry switches to electric guitar for Cumberland and New Speedway, then back to acoustic for Brokedown Palace.  Pigpen plays piano again on this tune. SET 2 is the only NRPS tune from this show to make it into circulation so far. SET 3 is an electric Dead set.  There was also a NRPS set between the acoustic and electric Dead sets but tape hasn't surfaced.  Candyman cuts in at ""Good morning Mr. Benson."" The #3:31 of tape from the conclusion of Good Lovin' that has always criculated as part of this tape (between Sittin' On Top Of The World and Big Boy Pete) turns out to be the last 3:31 of the 9/18/70 Good Lovin'. During the Jam out of Not Fade Away Jerry feints at Goin' Down The Road and Mountain Jam but settles into neither before transiting into the Bid You Goodnight Jam.  This Caution has few rivals from any year, and the Feedback that follows is ""buzz-saw music"" at its best. SBD cassette tapes of the acoustic and electric Dead sets of this show have been circulating since the mid-70s at the latest.  Reportedly there is an AUD of the acoustic set.  Recently Bill Gadsden, Jim Wise and others put a clean copy of 1st gen reels into circulation on CDs.  They sound great (and add the one NRPS tune).

The FM tape of Truckin' breaks off as a DJ's talk cuts in and generally does not circulate with the rest of the tape.  There is also about 2:30 of 'interview' between a KSAN DJ and Pigpen, who injured his fingers playing tambourine because the crew didn't manage to bring his organ along to the gig.

The Other One sequence is unusual in that they don't go back into Cryptical but take it right up to that point and then transit into NFA Drums instead.  Fragments of the Goin' Down The Road theme show up as early as 3:30 into the first NFA but even after it is fully stated they never sing the lyrics.

The Capitol Theater's Village Voice ad for October 1 lists shows (""featurning NRPS"") at 8:00 PM on November 5th, 6th, 7th & 8th; there's no further mention of these shows at all in the the Capitol's Voice ads for 10/29 and 11/5, while ads for the shows at the 46th St. Rock Palace in Brooklyn are prominent in these same issues. On Thursday and Sunday the show consisted of an acoustic Dead set, a NRPS set, and an electric Dead set.  On Friday and Saturday, they added a second electric Dead set."

SET 1 is the electric Dead set.  According to Dave Tamarkin, who attended and taped this show, the entire electric segment was all one set, with a long pause to correct technical difficulties between Good Lovin' and Alligator. The first 3:10 of the Jam after Alligator is just Jerry & the drummers; this Jam involves allusions to Not Fade Away, Goin' Down The Road, The Other One and Caution, but never settles into any steady riff despite the drummers energetic efforts to herd it into Not Fade from 7:30 on -- when they finally do slip into it by the back door at 10:39 the effect is explosive.  The dovetail into Goin' Down The Road 3 minutes later is as deft; this version features the additional verse ""Mama told me son don't go down there.""  There are Caution hints in the transition from Mountain Jam back to Not Fade.  Pigpen's harmonica is prominent early in Caution -- the Jamming here is over the top, the segue into Lovelight takes it from a roar to a whisper to a roar in 3 seconds.

This is superior to the version Teddy Goodbear and his buddy put into circulation a couple years ago.  I believe Jim Wise had a hand in re-transcribing the tapes."" TAPES OF 11/6/70 There is no SBD master of this show in the vault.  There are parts of three AUD masters from this show in circulation. 1AUD:  The so-called ""usher"" tape, made by an usher at the venue, Ken Leigh, on a Sony T-110 cassette deck, from the center loge.  Circulating copies of this master include the soundcheck; the acoustic Dead set through El Paso, which breaks off after 2:08, (sometimes also a tag end of Uncle John's Band); the complete NRPS set; and the complete electric set complete.  This master tends to include tunings between songs.  It is a good job of AUD taping for the period.  There is a cut in Lovelight at 7:30, at the tape flip. 2AUD:  The circulating segment of this master contains I'm A King Bee through Sugar Magnolia.  This master is easily distinguished by the guy yelping just off mic immediately before the beginning of the first Truckin' vocals.  This master is almost as good as 1AUD; it may be Marty Weinberg's.  It tends to clip out pauses between tunes.  Whoever made this tape, it would be useful to turn up the rest of it.  At the end of the cassette Side A of this tape there is a copy of the Easy Wind from the AUD of 7/10/70 after I Know You Rider; this tune has sometimes been mistakenly thought to belong to 11/6/70.  (Marty Weinberg probably mastered 7/10/70 AUD.) 3AUD:  This tape supplies the conclusion of the acoustic set -- #El Paso (the last #2:37), Brokedown, Uncle John -- used to patch some copies of 1AUD.  It was mastered by Dave Tamarkin with a Sony dictaphone -- his first show and his first effort as a taper.  Copies of the complete acoustic set in this master also circulate.  It is a mediocre AUD tape with lots of audience noise & tinny sound. Recently Teddy GoodBear & David Tamarkin assembled a 4-CD set of this show using a 2nd gen copy of 1AUD, with the acoustic set patched with 3AUD.  This 4-CD set includes the NRPS set, now circulating for the first time.  Another set is in preparation, from tape transcripts assembled by Jim Wise and with production work by Jack Warner, which will comprise first generation copies of this material (1/01)."

SET 1 is the acoustic Dead set.  SET 2 is from the NRPS set, perhaps not quite complete.  The Sweet Lovin One false start occurs because Jerry's pedal steel guitar loses sound.  There's a fiddler on Henry -- pretty cool.  SET 3 is the first electric set.  After Casey Jones to end the set Bobby says ""We're gonna take a short break, and we'll be back.  How's that?""  See 11/07/70b for the second electric set and further Comments."

Total time  3:11:01 +.  This list appears to be complete, with the possible exception of the NRPS set, and perhaps a final encore.  The timings given here represent a composite of 1AUD and 2AUD. 1AUD:  This is Jack Toner's master.  Circulating copies contain the complete acoustic set, the NRPS set except Henry & Last Lonely Eagle, the complete 1st electric set, and Attics through I Know You Rider from the 2nd electric set.  There is a cut in It Hurts Me Too and another, 47 seconds long, in The Other One, starting at 5:56, but the Drums are complete & intact on this tape.  It is missing I'm A King Bee & Good Lovin' and is clipped at the beginnings and ends of many songs.  This master is inferior to 2AUD but its Ripple lacks the other master's annoying chatter and it supplies parts of the show still missing on all circulating copies of 2AUD.  It is weakest during the acoustic set.  The electric sets are B+/A- tape for the period. 2AUD:  This is Marty Weinberg's master, onto 7"" Uher reels, from the center loge.  Except for the chatter that mars Ripple and Dirty Business, this is truly an excellent AUD tape.  Circulating copies contain Deep Elem Blues through El Paso from the acoustic set, Dirty Business, Henry, Last Lonely Eagle, Louisiana Lady and Honky Tonk Women from the NRPS set, plus the complete first and second electric sets.  The Drums between Truckin' & The Other One have about 3:30 minutes cut out.  This master includes I'm A King Bee and a complete Good Lovin'. 3AUD:  Ken Leigh mastered tape of this show.  A complete copy of his acoustic set tape is in circulation.  His versions of Cumbrland Blues, It Hurts Me Too, BIODL, Truckin' > Drums/ , Attics, Big Boss Man are combined with other tracks from 2AUD to make up the 3-CD set assembled by Jim Wise. The 3-CD set recently assembled by Jim Wise contains everything listed above as circulating from 2AUD except El Paso, I'm A King Bee, and only the last 3:05 of Good Lovin'. There is no SBD master of Grateful Dead from this show in the vault."

SET 1 is acoustic Dead; timings from the 2nd AUD master (2AUD). (1)  Bobby on King Kong vs. Godzilla Jerry says ""Be back in a few minutes with the New Riders"" after the first set.  SET 2 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel; timings from 1AUD.  SET 3 is electric Dead; timings are from the 3rd AUD master (3AUD) through Casey Jones, thereafter 1AUD supplemented with 2AUD.  Following Friend Of The Devil Jerry plays the guitar intro of Mississippi John Hurt's version of Stack O Lee (cf. Taj Mahal's recording); after he breaks off Bobby says ""Sorry, that one hasn't passed the hotelroom stage yet.  We don't know all the words"" (thanks to Robert Gilpen for this identification).  There is a Tighten Up Jam starting about 4 minutes in to Dancin.'  There is a The Main Ten Jam in Dark Star from 16:03 to 20:30.  GDTRFB has additional lyrics (""Mama told me son don't go down there ...""); there is a brief Mountain Jam starting around 5:10 of GDTRFB.

Notes: *No noise reduction has been performed.  I have used SoundForge only to normalize levels and smooth cuts and fades. *The beginnings of all of the tunes from the NRPS set are missing from the reel master.  Unfortunately, there is no known master which can provide these pieces. *A small master tape pause obscures the transition to Dark Star. No more than a few seconds of music are missing. *There is a small master reel glitch at 0:40 of Dancin' in the Streets. ***Caveat emptor: I have tried to be fairly thorough, but there may be a few other small anomalies on this recording.  We are after all talking about an audience recording from 1970.*** TAPES OF 11/8/70 Since no SBD survives in the vault of this alltime classic show we are especially lucky that there are parts of four AUD masters in circulation. The best master as far as sound, 1AUD was recorded from the balcony by Marty Weinberg with a Uher reel-to-reel deck.  It is recognizable by the following defects:  The 1AUD acoustic set master is missing Dire Wolf and I Know You Rider entirely (many copies of this master patch these tunes in from 2AUD or from 4AUD, others don't).  All copies of 1AUD are missing nearly all the pauses between songs in the acoustic, including part of the Godzilla discussion and a number of other comments from the band; these cuts are on the master, the results of Weinberg's characteristically heavy hand on the pause button.  The 1AUD master of the electric set is missing the opening 1:46 of Morning Dew, the 1st 9 seconds of Around And Around, 1:02 of Jamming in It's All Over Now, Baby Blue starting at 7:37, the first 3 seconds of Truckin', the first couple seconds of Dark Star, and 4:19 of Jamming from Dancin, starting at 2:06.  (Some copies in circulation patch the beginning of Morning Dew with 2AUD; some patch the middle of Dancin with 2AUD, and of these some return to 1AUD for the last 3:56 of Dancin and others continue with 2AUD through to the end of the song.  Also, many circulating tapes that start with 1AUD and patch through to the end with 2AUD continue through to the end of the show with 2AUD's version of the concluding sequence, NFA through Good Lovin', despite the fact that 2AUD's GDTRFB is missing fully 3 minutes of Jamming starting at 4:12..) The 2AUD master was recorded by Ken Leigh with a Sony TC-110 with a built in mic, also apparently from the balcony.  Besides this cut in GDTRFB, which includes the brief Mountain Jam, the 2AUD master of this sequence is distinguished by a woman saying ""hey, more"" during the opening NFA Drums.  2AUD has more audience noise than 1AUD.  It is not widely circulated except fragmentarily as patches in Dew and Dancin on copies of 1AUD, but the complete acoustic set and all of the electric set except New Orleans > Searchin and Truckin' through Dancin can be found; there is no sign of the NRPS set in 2AUD.  The 2AUD acoustic set tape contains the entire set continuously, including the Space between songs and makes a better way to listen to this brilliant set.  The I Know You Rider has 1:40 cut starting around 3:00.  All circulating copies of 2AUD are missing the last minute plus of Uncle John's Band; some copies patch this in from 1AUD but many don't.  Clearly on several occasions people have taken partial or complete versions of 1AUD and 2AUD and assembled various combinations of the two tapes to make more nearly complete versions of the show -- other combinations besides those noted above. 3AUD has only recently come into circulation.  It was made on a Sony dictaphone but apparently not by Dave Tamarkin, though perhaps by his brother Jeff; its sound quality improves as it progresses; probably the mic was moved closer to the PA in the course of the performance.  3AUD contains only the electric set; it is the only master that includes the opening 3 seconds of Truckin' and the first bar of NFA; it is missing 0:47 of Good Lovin' starting 5:40 after Drums [4:07].  Most circulating copies of 1AUD require speed correction, whereas copies of 3AUD are more likely to be good speed. 4AUD is represented in circulation only by Dire Wolf and I Know You Rider, used to patch some old copies of the 1AUD acoustic set.  The 4AUD I Know You Rider is complete, whereas the 2AUD Rider has 1:40 cut starting around 3:00.  4AUD's I Know You Rider lacks this cut, and so includes additional vocals and an extended guitar solo.  It is possible that some patches on old copies of 1AUD which are assumed to be from 2AUD are in fact from 4AUD.  It would be great to turn up the complete master of this tape. On the best AUD master right before Casey Jones a guy near the mic (the taper?) says ""It's going to be a night full of surprises"" and a woman says back ""really!"" like she knows it & she's stoked to the max.  I'd love to meet her."

There are splices between every song on this tape and the rather random sequence of songs also suggests that it is a selection from this show rather than a sequence of songs as played.  There was also a NRPS set.

The Other One moves off into deep Space quickly.  This AUD tape is really pretty bad.  There was also a NRPS set.
3097,1970,1970-11-11,Grateful Dead,46th Street Rock Palace,"Brooklyn , NY",11/11/1970,[2:59:14] ; Intro [1:36] ; Casey Jones [5:05] % Me And My Uncle [3:05] % [0:22] % Cold Rain And Snow [3:52] ; [1:18] ; China Cat Sunflower [3:14] > Jam [3:52] > I Know You Rider [4:18] ; [0:12] % Big Railroad Blues [4:47] ; [0:45] ; Mama Tried [2:35] % It Hurts Me Too [5:21] ; [0:03] % Cryptical Envelopment [1:54] > Drums [6:34] > The Other One [6:47] > Cryptical Envelopment [2:47] > Sugar Magnolia [5:20] ; [0:16] % Hard To Handle [9:09] ; Truckin' [6:34] % Drums [0:40] > Good Lovin' [1:50] > Drums [5:09] > Jam [4:14] > La Bamba [1:06] > Jam [0:54] > Good Lovin' [3:52] ; [0:06] % Cumberland Blues [5:57] ; [0:07] % Goin' Down The Road Feeling Bad [6:27] ; Intro [1:30] ; John's Other [5:52] % Uncle Sam Blues [6:47] % Around And Around [4:03] % Blues Jam [7:55] ; Drums [0:06] > Not Fade Away [4:00] > Jam [7:30] > Drums [0:42] > Jam [8:34] ; Come Back Baby [8:52],"This may be more than one set.  If there was a setbreak it probably came after Good Lovin', or possibly after Cumberland.  Jack Casady & Jorma Kaukonen enter to hoots & hollers about 2 minutes into Goin' Down The Road, Papa John Creach immediately afterward, and they continue on stage throughout the rest of the show; Jorma takes lead vocals on Uncle Sam Blues and Come Back Baby.  There was also a NRPS set. There is a brief Saint Stephen Jam starting 7:30 into Hard To Handle.  Early in Jam1 there are references to Hey Bo Diddley and Who Do You Love; around 3:20 Jerry riffs on Nobody's Fault in quadruple time.  Around 6:30 into this Jam a riff resembling Tequila shows up, anticipating Jam2, which returns to this figure several times.  There is a break in the tape 41 seconds after the last Drums but fair continuity in the Jam; 20-40 seconds at most are lost in this lacuna The first 110 minutes of the recording are not too bad; thereafter the sound quality deteriorates severely (the 2nd 90-minute tape starts with Drums > Good Lovin').  Reportedly, the master was made by one Mike Tannenbaum on reels concealed in a wheelchair at the center of the 5th row (the back of the orchestra pit?) ; the first 90 minutes of the tape sound consistent with this; during the 2nd tape it sounds as if the taper perhaps got swarmed when the crowd got up & thereafter his mics were muffled by surrounding bodies, but there are also other problems with the second 90 minutes of this tape, among them pitch problems perhaps caused by the deck bouncing with the dancing floorboards.  Whatever the cause, the quality of reproduction on the 2nd tape of this set is piss poor."

SET 2 is the tape which has long circulated apparently mislabeled ""Anderson Theater, NYC 11/23/70.""  A variety of lines of argument suggest that this tape in fact comes from Fillmore East 11/16/70 and was mastered by the same crew that did 5/15/70, 9/20/70 and other surreptitious soundboard masters from this venue.  It is not clear where the good Lovin fits nor how much more might have been played than appears on these tapes. In the pause before Mama Tried Bobby sings The Frozen Logger off mic.  The alternating harmonica and organ on Truckin' > Other One is Pigpen.  Winwood sits in on organ on Hard To Handle, Big RR and Not Fade > Goin' Down > Not Fade.  The harmonica on Big Railroad Blues may not be Pigpen.  It's probably Chris Wood who takes the first vocals on Not Fade Away and is audible intermittantly throughout the following sequence.  Uncle John's Band has a brief prelude jam with Will Scarlet on harmonica.  Uncle John's sounds like an encore; Bobby says ""See y'all later"" afterward. Nearly all of China Cat Sunflower is missing on the SBD tape. Recently Bill Gadsden, Jim Wise and Frank Venezia put an 85-minute 2-CD set into circulation containing a fresh transcript of a 1st gen reel of this SBD, including a more nearly complete version of Hard To Handle.  Previously, this tape circulated for years in a completely scrambled sequence (created when it was transferred from reels to cassette).  There is also a 24 minute very lo gen SBD tape containing Mama Tried, Truckin' > Other One, and Uncle John. According to Corry Arnold on 11/14/70 at the Fillmore East after Frank Zappa's performance Grace Slick came on stage and announced on behalf of Bill Graham that the Dead and the Airplane would be playing a surprise concert at the Fillmore East on Monday, November 16th.  On the 16th the very pregnant Slick was unable to make the gig but Hot Tuna substituted for the Airplane.  This is why this show does not appear in ads and playbills etc. Richard Volet writes:  ""Fillmore East, fall 1970 (maybe earlier that year?) Before Mickey Hart left, after T.C. left. The concert was originally billed as Airplane/Dead, but the Airplane broke up right then (I believe that week) and Hot Tuna took their place. I remember Hot Tuna playing with Will Scarlet on Harmonica, but I think without Papa John Creach. The New Riders played next, with Garcia on pedal steel.  The Dead set included Dear Mr. Fantasy with Stevie Winwood on vocal and organ, and guest appearance also of Tom Constanten on Dark Star/Saint Stephen. This was with two drummmers.  (I also remember Garcia playing a Gibson SG and weir playing a hollow body Guild.) "" See Comments on 11/23/70. A SBD Traffic set from Fillmore East 11/23/70 is also in circulation."

The circulating AUD tape was mastered by Marty Weinberg on 7"" Uher reels.  As customarily with Weinberg's masters, there are usually pauses on the tape between songs.  This makes it impossible to prove the sequence of tunes from this master, and there is some confusion about the correct order of songs.  On most circulating cassettes the Good Lovin' sequence is placed last, after Uncle John's Band on the second half of side B of the second 90-minute cassette, presumably to keep from breaking it over a cassette side when transcribing from reels.  After Mama Tried seems the likeliest spot where it belongs, but there is no proof.  After Casey Jones Jerry says ""We're gonna take a little break.""  Probably the preceding was all one set, but it is possible there was another break earlier. Jorma Kaukonen plays throughout SET 2.  The Instrumental following All Over Now is his.  Jack Casady joins on bass starting with the Jam into Darling Carey.  It's Marmaduke on vocals in Darling Carey.  Many cassettes have the order of these two Jams reversed -- again, presumably to avoid splitting the longer one over a flip (and again, no proof that the sequnce listed is correct)."

Andrew Smith, who attended the show, confirms that this concert consisted of a single NRPS set followed by a single long electric Dead set.  Most circulating tapes have the contents re-arranged somewhat, presumably to fit onto cassettes from reel masters. SET 1 is NRPS with Garcia, pedal steel.  Besides the stub-end of Louisiana Lady and the clips between songs this appears to be the complete set. SET 2 is this single long electric Dead set, complete except for clips between songs, a cut in Dew at 7:17, a cut in the Jam out of Truckin' at 6:52, a very brief cut (probably a drop-out) at 12:29 into The Other One, and two cuts in the Not Fade Away sequence.  It's possible the opening Drums of Good Lovin' have been clipped on the circulating tape but this Good Lovin' doesn't have a drum duo in the usual place either -- the drummers start one their duo at the regular spot (2:04) but Jerry just keeps on Jamming and after a few seconds the rest of the band kicks in behind him too.  This monster Good Lovin' is also interesting for the way it anticipates the Pigpen rap versions of '71. The tape cuts just as they are going into the Goin' Down The Road theme at 5:00, and resumes seven seconds later during the final vocals of this tune, passing into the Bid You Jam that usually concludes the tune within about a minute -- that is, we are missing most of the song, several minutes at the least.  After just 29 seconds of Not Fade Reprise Jamming, Jerry takes this into a unique little Jam that lasts for 51 seconds and then shifts back to Not Fade.  The tape cuts for good 1:20 later, during the beginning of the Not Fade vocals Reprise.  Altogether we must be missing at least 5-6 minutes from this sequence. This is a high energy show in many respects.  Jerry seems unusually keyed up.  It's not too bad a job of AUD taping, either, though not optimal by any means.  The mics probably moved closer to the PA between the NRPS and electric sets.  Thereafter the mics sound like they're not too far back in the hall -- they are fairly well-saturated but there's still some hall resonance and bass boom; audience noise isn't too bad."

It was indeed the Jerry Hahn Brotherhood opening, with a spectacular set. Next up was a blues band (not Howard Wales) that I can't recall the name, but John Kahn was their bass player. The New Riders played next. Around 2 AM, Garcia, Lesh, Hart, and David Crosby came out. They opened with ""Drop Down Mama,"" and also played ""Alabama Bound,"" ""Triad"" and ""Deep Elem Blues"" before I was dragged kicking and screaming from the hall by my ride, who needed to work the next morning. The ads billed the show as ""Acoustic Dead"" but this segment, at least, was electric. At one point, Garcia introduced the group as ""David and the Ding-A-Lings"" (not Dorks!) and Crosby countered with the name ""Jerry and the Jets.""  Weir and Pigpen were visible wandering around backstage, so it is entirely possible, even likely, that the entire Dead played even later, as curfew clearly was not an issue."

Two separate tapes make up the circulating recordings from this show.  Video of the concert was broadcast by KQED-TV San Francisco with the first 4 songs simulcast on KSAN-FM San Francisco.  KQED-TV station ID before Sugar Magnolia.  The circulating tape of these tunes is the AUD tape; on the circulating tape there is a cut in Monkey And The Engineer at around 1:00 and Easy Wind breaks off about 3 minutes before its conclusion.  According to DeadBase IX a Me And My Uncle followed Easy Wind; but if so there is no trace of it on circulating tape.  This tape is actually from the audience tape whose tapers are apprehended between Sugar Mag and China Cat; it is quite an excellent AUD tape.  It was recorded on Sony ECM-22P mics into a Sony 770 1/4-track reel recorder at 7.5 ips by the same night crew that did the El Monte '70 tapes, the Hollywood Palladium 8/71 AUDs, 7/1/73 -- who was that Masked Man? The other tape in circulation is a pre-broadcast SBD from KQED-TV; it picks up with Big Railroad Blues.  In the pause before Dire Wolf they Tease Cryptical repeatedly.  The Other One goes directly into Black Peter, entirely eliding the Cryptical Envelopment Reprise and Jam.  In the interval between Sugar Mag and China Cat a taper in the audience is busted, with Phil directing a spotlight upon him.  In the background of the China Cat > Rider that follows, but definitely on mic, there is a lady screaming out of control -- she sounds very dosed, spun out hard, and at the moment not really having that much fun.  She screws up the recording of China Cat > Rider pretty good and continues some in the pause that follows, where there's also a woman on mic looking for her cape -- plainly things were a little out of control backstage; perhaps there was a mic live that shouldn't have been somewhere backstage or in the wings. The show-concluding Good Lovin' > Uncle John's Band that follows is an alltime classic.  It used to circulate as Side B of a cassette whose Side A contained the last 45 minutes of Fillmore West 6/7/69, with the concluding Lovelight with Janis breaking off before the end, and sometimes this Good Lovin' > Uncle John was erroneously labeled ""6/7/69"" (nearly 6 months before the tune's premier!).  Where versions of Good Lovin' earlier in the year have a passage of Drums, here the drummers move to the foreground and Jerry and Phil take turns discreetly Jamming with them for about 4 minutes before the whole band resumes Jamming at full blast.  And like the Good Lovin's of 11/29/70 and 12/28/70, this one anticipates the Pigpen rap arrangement of spring '71.

Will Scarlet is said to be the harmonica player.  Tunes played are Johnny B. Goode, Around And Around, Rock Me Baby, Not Fade Away, and I Know You Rider (in Jorma's arrangement).  There is a SBD cassette side in circulation.  The performances are not very exciting."

Jim Powell said (when this was considered part of 4/25/71) ""[... ] It's possible that the King Bee and Rub are misattributed, because they came into circulation as filler on later shows from the run, but it's established they are different versions than any in circulation. and the Lovelight is a hint more dubiously dated 4/25/71, as the entry remarks."" of the Lovelight, he adds ""It is certainly from this period (one drummer but some congas at the beginning, presumably from Pigpen)."""

This list used to include a King Bee, the Rub and Lovelight, from a SB 30 tape, but they have been moved to a separate ??/??/71 entry. This list also used to include an Uncle John's Band encore, but it has been removed since it was not on David Lemieux's list, and it did not have timings from the tape. Jim Powell says ``These lists [the ones with timings] derive from the [90] minutes of SBD now circulating from this show. These tapes are plainly incomplete and there was also a NRPS set. The tapes circulate in [two] pieces: a) a 45-minute side containing China Cat through Casey Jones and Morning Dew through Second that Emotion; b) a 45-minute side containing Good Lovin through Uncle John [...]. China Cat through Casey Jones is the 1st set conclusion. [ ... ] After Bertha there is a longish pause during which, among other shenanigans, Phil announces ""Alright all you wise guys write your requests on your girlfriends' bosoms and send 'em up here."" The Set 2 list looks more nearly complete. The tape of Second that Emotion breaks off [...].'' thayer Jennings says ""Second that Emotion cuts off with a significant portion missing. Splice in Sing Me Back Home, with perhaps 8 seconds missing (accounted for in timing). Splice in Not Fade Away (#1), with approximately 4 seconds missing (accounted for in timing)."""

Actual venue is unknown A Note About Dick's Pick 35: The Legend of the Houseboat Tapes: Although the Grateful Dead's vault is enormous and impressively full, the band certainly doesn't have a tape of every show it played; in fact, they don't even have a copy of every show they recorded. Tapes drifted off in a variety of ways - including Jerry Garcia handing them out. And therein lies the story of Dick's Picks 35.

This spring, our archivist David Lemieux got a call from Donna Jean Godchaux-Mackay. It seems that in the late summer of 1971, just before Keith Godchaux began rehearsals with the Dead, Garcia handed him a big box of tapes and said, ""Here, this is our most recent tour. Learn our music."" The irony was that Donna Jean doubts mightily Keith ever bothered to listen to them - he'd never listened to the Dead all that much before he auditioned, first with Garcia and then the rest of the band - he just had an uncanny innate facility for the music. In any case, he left the tapes on his parents' houseboat in Alameda, CA, and there they stayed. For almost 35 years.

In the spring of 2005, Keith's brother Brian and son Zion were cleaning out the houseboat, found the tapes, and gave them to Donna, whose jaw dropped. One call to Lemieux later, and the Dead's long-lost missing tour from the summer of 1971 had resurfaced. Master tapes include April 28 and 29 at the Fillmore East (released as ""Ladies and Gentlemen,"" which was mixed from the multi-track masters), the 7/31 Yale Bowl (alas, the reels were blank), a small piece of the second Hollywood Palladium show, the complete shows from Berkeley Community Theatre 8/14 & 8/15, and others. Dick's Pick #35 is the complete San Diego (8/7/71) show, all that was salvageable of the 8/24 Chicago show, and an hour-plus of the Hollywood Palladium (8/6), which is all that existed on the tapes.

Not a soundboard-recorded note of that tour's music circulates among Dead Heads, so this is a truly remarkable find. How they survived 35 years in a watery environment simply proves, yet once again - if you needed convincing - that God smiles on the Grateful Dead."

There is a splice in I Know You Rider; at 0:21 it cuts off and comes back in right away on cue before the ""Lay down last night"" verse. Two or three runs through the chorus are missing. Casey Jones comes in on the ""High on cocaine,"" chorus before the first verse. (1) Good Lovin' {#6:33}> Mind Left Body Jam {1:41}> Good Lovin' {8:10} Fades in 30 seconds before the first verse.

I was only able to audibly verify through most of the He's Gone, at which point the version I heard runs out. The rest of the list is based on the label from a transcription of the seven inch reels, where, according to the label, the He's Gone is complete but the GDTRFB is chopped and the concluding NFA does not appear. There were enough technical problems that it would be wise to verify this show's lists with audience tape. Both the multitracks and the two tracks from this show have problems. (I post this here mostly for the Other one timing, since I recall someone collecting those -- and because we can independently verify that at least these songs appear to be correct, based on two different versions of the sbd recordings from the show.)"

In addition there's no splice between Playing and He's Gone.  There is a splice in The Other One on both the AUD and the SBD.

I was walking down the street and coming down the other side of the street was this guy with this cigar box.  And the cigar box was kind of buzzing and humming.  Making all sorts fo noise, all kind of noise and uh and so I stopped him and I asked him, ""Pardon me sir.  What do you got in that box?  I mean you know it's making all that noise, humming and buzzing.""  And he said, ""Well this is my bee collection.  It's a collection of bees."" I said, ""That's a bee collection?""  ""Yes I have ten thousand bees in here."", he said.  I said, ""Well you got ten thousand bees in there.  Don't they all get crushed?""  He said, ""Well fuck 'em.""

Complete Loose Lucy timing supercedes previous listing showing it cut at 4:59. Splice in Playing In The Band at 8:38.  Hard to tell how much is missing although it can't be more than a few minutes and could be only a few seconds.  Splice in Truckin' at 6:23. Could be a minute or two missing here. The first Eyes has quite a bit of exploratory jamming without dropping to that Dm riff (or whatever you want to call it), which is present to some degree in all other known '73 versions of the song.  Jerry plays the chord on the final notes of the song before changing to China Doll. By February 15, the change had been worked out.The cut in Wave that Flag at 1:25 is missing a full chorus after the second verse.

There are segues between Halfstep, Stella Blue, and Jack Straw. Some equipment problems delay the start of Truckin'. There's a marginally insignificant splice at 6:45 of the Other one. DB IX lists Casey Jones as Encore one, one More Saturday Night as Encore two. Bob says ""Thank you, good night"", following Johnny B. Goode. On the tape however there is only 34 seconds between Johnny B. Goode and Casey Jones and there is no cut. There is no evidence to prove that One More Saturday Night was a second encore.

That genealogy is completely fabricated.  Not only was the recording not mastered on reel, but Amick put his master cassette onto reel and all direct copies he made, that we know of (2), came from that.  Judging from the drastic difference in sound quality, this other listing is AUDMC>R>?>C>DAT>CD at best.  The difference in sound quality is absolutely striking. notes: At 3:24 into Casey Jones, something is switched on the master tape (bias?) which results in a great improvement of sound quality.  Also, Amick edited Drums on his reel.  It might also be missing from the master, as there are no copies to be found (now) with more of the Drums from his recording.  No additional editing was performed to mask this original edit."

This is actually from 9/20. An eyewitness to the 17th claims that the show originally scheduled for the 18th was canceled due to lack of ticket sales. Show not in circulation.  Another account is that the musical director for WAER-FM, S.U. radio station, interviewed the band before the 9/17 show and the indication was that 9/17 was the only show scheduled."

Because of this, we cannot be certain that this is the complete 2nd set - Around And Around through Loose Lucy may very well have been played at the show but are missing from the circulating audio. According to a vault source (5/97), this is the show setlist: Set One: The Promised Land ; Sugaree ; Mexicali Blues ; They Love Each Other ; Me And Bobby McGee ; Deal ; Black Throated Wind ; Brown Eyed Women ; Beat It On Down The Line ; Brokedown Palace ; Jack Straw ; China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider ; Around And Around.

Phil is notably outraged at what is happening and the disturbance goes on for at least another two and a half minutes at which point the band plays One More Saturday Night. For this reason, it is highly unlikely that either song is an ""Encore"". The Other One timing is: Jam [7:59] > 1st Verse [0:39] > Space Jam [1:48]"

The last 26 seconds of Here Comes Sunshine is missing on our copy of the SBD and is patched in using an AUD master from a cassette copy of unknown low generation. 22 seconds in Eyes Of The World are patched from this AUD source also.  The 22-second cut in Eyes looks like a cassette tape flip introduced when the reels were transcribed to 1st gen cassette. The missing conclusion of Here Comes Sunshine is harder to account for on this hypothesis, but there seems a reasonable chance that both missing segments are intact on the master reels.  Meanwhile... First set highlights include TLEO, Row Jimmy, GSET and China Cat >
Rider.  The Here Comes Sunshine times almost 16 minutes, is the longest known on circulating tape and probably the best.  The Dark Star is the third longest known at 43:28, and one of the all time best.  It is the fraternal twin of 11/11/73. Dave Greenberg did the patches.  David Gans supplied DATs of the 1st gen cassette SBD and Jim Powell instigated the project, supplied the AUD cassette used to patch the SBD's defects, and wrote this note."" According to an eyewitness to the show and someone local to the area, the venue for this show is actually Public Hall, the same place as the 10/28/72 show. Apparently, the confusion comes from the fact that the Public Hall, Music Hall and the Convention Center are all on the same block.Of side interest is the report that a woman jumped on the stage during Sugar Magnolia to dance in front of Bob."

The CD distributed by the original taper, Teddy ""Goodbear"" attests that the 12:26 time is, in fact, the correct timing. There is what sounds like a minor splice in Stella Blue."
